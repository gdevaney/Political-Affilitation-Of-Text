To solve the challenges higher interest rates create, including a possible interest financing spiral, MMT generally says that the Fed will be tasked with keeping interest rates low by making the Federal government, through the Fed, the consistent (if not the primary) purchaser of bonds. This is a different mission for the Fed than it has now. The Fed would no longer be tasked with intervening to keep prices stable because it would be too busy buying bonds.

school, limiting the ability of women and girls to perform income-generating work, pursue education or skills building, or avoid exposure to COVID–19', 'Whereas, globally, women living in poverty will

in those plans will be the most affected by the direct and indirect effects of the COVID–19 crisis, remain only 17.3 percent funded', 'Whereas estimates show that, globally, women are included in only 24 percent of national response plans for the COVID–19 crisis, and women and girls have been largely excluded from leadership and decision making related to responses to the crisis, resulting in

(The term covered employee is defined in section 101(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1301(3)). See 825.102 of these regulations for that definition.) The purpose of this part is to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of section 202 of the CAA. (b)These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors (Board) of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, pursuant to sections 202(d) and 304 of the CAA, which direct the Board to promulgate regulations implementing section 202 that are the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) of section 202 of the CAA except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be more effective for the implementation of the rights and protections under this section.. The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters for which section 202 of the CAA requires regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board’s considered judgment, based on the information available to it at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) of section 202 of the CAA..\n(c)On December 20, 2019, Congress enacted the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (subtitle A of title LXXVI of division F of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, Public Law 116–92, December 20, 2019) (FEPLA). FEPLA amended the FMLA to allow most Federal employees, including eligible employees in the legislative branch, to substitute up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave (PPL) for unpaid FMLA leave granted in connection with the birth of an employee’s son or daughter or for the placement of a son or daughter with an employee for adoption or foster care.In order to implement FEPLA in the legislative branch, the Board is amending its substantive FMLA regulations pursuant to the CAA rulemaking procedures set forth at sections 202(d) and 304 of the CAA. The Secretary of Labor has not promulgated FEPLA regulations, however, because FEPLA does not extend PPL to private sector employees or other employees directly covered by FMLA title I. The Board has determined that these circumstances constitute good cause for modification of its substantive FMLA regulations in order to effectively implement FEPLA’s rights and protections to covered employees in the legislative branch.  (d)In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the legislative branch. However, by making these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive difference between these regulations and those of the Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n(e)Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, (2 U.S.C. 1384(b)(4)), the Board of Directors is required to recommend to Congress a method of approval for these regulations. As the Board has adopted the same regulations for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the other covered entities and facilities, it therefore recommends that the adopted regulations be approved by concurrent resolution of the Congress. ACoverage Under The Family And Medical Leave Act, As Made Applicable By The Congressional Accountability Act 825.100The Family and Medical Leave Act (a)The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), allows eligible employees of an employing office to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months (See 825.200(b)) because of the birth of a child and to care for the newborn child, because of the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed to care for a family member (child, spouse, or parent) with a serious health condition, because the employee’s own serious health condition makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her job, or because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty). In addition, eligible employees of a covered employing office may take job-protected, unpaid leave, or substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 26 workweeks in a single 12–month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. In certain cases, FMLA leave may be taken on an intermittent basis rather than all at once, or the employee may work a part-time schedule. \n(b)An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share during the leave period. Subject to 825.208(k), the employing office or a disbursing or other financial office may recover its share only if the employee does not return to work for a reason other than the serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s covered family member, the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, or another reason beyond the employee’s control. (c)An employee generally has a right to return to the same position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and working conditions at the conclusion of the leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n(d)The employing office generally has a right to advance notice from the employee. In addition, the employing office may require an employee to submit certification to substantiate that the leave is due to the serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s covered family member, due to the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, or because of a qualifying exigency. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied policy, the employing office may also require that an employee present a certification of fitness to return to work when the absence was caused by the employee’s serious health condition (See 825.312 and 825.313)). The employing office may delay restoring the employee to employment without such certificate relating to the health condition which caused the employee’s absence. 825.101Purpose of the FMLA (a)FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition, for the care of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, or because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status. The FMLA is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity. It was intended that the FMLA accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employing offices, and in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in minimizing the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.\n(b)The FMLA was predicated on two fundamental concerns—the needs of the American workforce, and the development of high-performance organizations. Increasingly, America’s children and elderly are dependent upon family members who must spend long hours at work. When a family emergency arises, requiring workers to attend to seriously-ill children or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, workers need reassurance that they will not be asked to choose between continuing their employment, and meeting their personal and family obligations or tending to vital needs at home.  (c)The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit employing offices as well as their employees. A direct correlation exists between stability in the family and productivity in the workplace. FMLA will encourage the development of high-performance organizations. When workers can count on durable links to their workplace they are able to make their own full commitments to their jobs. The record of hearings on family and medical leave indicate the powerful productive advantages of stable workplace relationships, and the comparatively small costs of guaranteeing that those relationships will not be dissolved while workers attend to pressing family health obligations or their own serious illness.\n825.102DefinitionsFor purposes of this part: (1)ADA means the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., as amended), as made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act.\n(2)Birth means the delivery of a child.

Where the employee performs work which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, or works for two or more employing offices at different times during the workweek, a joint employment relationship generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n(1)Where there is an arrangement between employing offices to share an employee’s services or to interchange employees', ' (2)Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly in the interest of the other employing office in relation to the employee', ' or\n(3)Where the employing offices are not completely disassociated with respect to the employee’s employment and may be deemed to share control of the employee, directly or indirectly, because one employing office controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other employing office.

The employee may give notice of need for FMLA leave, as described in 825.302 and 825.303, to whichever of these employing offices the employee chooses. If the employee makes a written request for restoration to one of these employing offices, that employing office shall be primarily responsible for job restoration, and the other employing office(s) may, subject to the limitations in 825.216, be responsible for accepting the employee returning from FMLA leave. 825.107Reserved\n825.108Reserved 825.109Reserved\n825.110Eligible employee, general rule\n(a)Subject to the exceptions provided in 825.111, an eligible employee is a covered employee of an employing office who: (1)Has been employed by any employing office for at least 12 months, and\n(2)Has been employed for at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. (b)Any service on active duty (as defined in 29 U.S.C. 2611(14)) by a covered employee who is a member of the National Guard or Reserves shall be counted as time during which such employee has been employed in an employing office for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section.\n(c)The 12 months an employee must have been employed by any employing office need not be consecutive months, provided: (1)Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, employment periods prior to a break in service of seven years or more need not be counted in determining whether the employee has been employed by any employing office for at least 12 months.\n(2)Employment periods preceding a break in service of more than seven years must be counted in determining whether the employee has been employed by any employing office for at least 12 months where: (A)The employee’s break in service is occasioned by the fulfillment of his or her Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et seq., covered service obligation. The period of absence from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service must be also counted in determining whether the employee has been employed for at least 12 months by any employing office. However, this section does not provide any greater entitlement to the employee than would be available under the USERRA', ' or \n(B)A written agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement, exists concerning the employing office’s intention to rehire the employee after the break in service (e.g., for purposes of the employee furthering his or her education or for childrearing purposes). (3)If an employee worked for two or more employing offices sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine whether it equals 12 months.\n(4)If an employee is maintained on the payroll for any part of a week, including any periods of paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other benefits or compensation are provided by the employing office (e.g., Federal Employees’ Compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), the week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment qualifies as at least 12 months, 52 weeks is deemed to be equal to 12 months. (5)Nothing in this section prevents employing offices from considering employment prior to a continuous break in service of more than seven years when determining whether an employee has met the 12–month employment requirement. However, if an employing office chooses to recognize such prior employment, the employing office must do so uniformly, with respect to all employees with similar breaks in service.\n(d)\n(1)If an employee was employed by two or more employing offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum of 1,250 hours has been reached. (2)Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined according to the principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as applied by section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), for determining compensable hours of work. The determining factor is the number of hours an employee has worked for one or more employing offices as defined by the CAA. The determination is not limited by methods of recordkeeping, or by compensation agreements that do not accurately reflect all of the hours an employee has worked for or been in service to the employing office. Any accurate accounting of actual hours worked under the FLSA’s principles, as made applicable by the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), may be used.\n(3)An employee returning from USERRA-covered service shall be credited with the hours of service that would have been performed but for the period of absence from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service in determining the employee’s eligibility for FMLA-qualifying leave. Accordingly, a person reemployed following USERRA-covered service has the hours that would have been worked for the employing office added to any hours actually worked during the previous 12–month period to meet the hours of service requirement. In order to determine the hours that would have been worked during the period of absence from work due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service, the employee’s pre-service work schedule can generally be used for calculations. (4)In the event an employing office does not maintain an accurate record of hours worked by an employee, including for employees who are exempt from the overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA and its regulations, the employing office has the burden of showing that the employee has not worked the requisite hours. An employing office must be able to clearly demonstrate, for example, that full time teachers (See 825.102 for definition) of an elementary or secondary school system, or institution of higher education, or other educational establishment or institution (who often work outside the classroom or at their homes) did not work 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months in order to claim that the teachers are not covered or eligible for FMLA leave.\n(e)The determination of whether an employee meets the hours of service requirement for any employing office and has been employed by any employing office for a total of at least 12 months, must be made as of the date the FMLA leave is to start. An employee may be on non-FMLA leave at the time he or she meets the 12-month eligibility requirement, and in that event, any portion of the leave taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason after the employee meets the eligibility requirement would be FMLA leave. See 825.300(b) for rules governing the content of the eligibility notice given to employees. 825.111Eligible employee, birth or placementFor purposes of leave under subparagraphs (A) or (B) of section 102(a)(1) of the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. 2612(a)(1)(A) or (B):\n(1)an eligible employee is a covered employee of an employing office', ' and (2)the eligibility requirements of section 825.110 shall not apply. See also 825.120-21.\n825.112Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule\n(a)Circumstances qualifying for leave. Employing offices covered by FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are required to grant leave to eligible employees: (1)For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child (See 825.120)', '\n(2)For the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care and the care of such son or daughter (See 825.121)', ' (3)To care for the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition (See 825.113 and 825.122)', '\n(4)Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee’s job (See 825.113 and 825.123)', ' (5)Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty status) (See 825.122 and 825.126)', ' and\n(6)To care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the covered servicemember (See 825.122 and 825.127). (b)Equal Application. The right to take leave under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, applies equally to male and female employees. A father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster care of a child.\n(c)Active employee. In situations where the employing office/employee relationship has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason. 825.113Serious health condition (a)For purposes of FMLA, serious health condition entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care as defined in 825.114 or continuing treatment by a health care provider as defined in 825.115.\n(b)The term incapacity means inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment therefore, or recovery therefrom. (c)The term treatment includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. A regimen of continuing treatment includes, for example, a course of prescription medication (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves', ' or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of FMLA leave. \n(d)Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic surgery) are not serious health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. Mental illness or allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of this section are met. 825.114Inpatient careInpatient care means an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity as defined in 825.113(b), or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care.\n825.115Continuing treatmentA serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any one or more of the following: (a)Incapacity and treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves:\n(1)Treatment two or more times, within 30 days of the first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist, by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider. (2)Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.\n(3)The requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for treatment by a health care provider means an in-person visit to a health care provider. The first (or only) in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity. (4)Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment is necessary within the 30-day period shall be determined by the health care provider.\n(5)The term extenuating circumstances in paragraph (a)(1) of this section means circumstances beyond the employee’s control that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by the health care provider. Whether a given set of circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed within the 30-day period, but the health care provider does not have any available appointments during that time period. (b)Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. See also 825.120.\n(c)Chronic conditions. Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which: (1)Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a year) for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider', '\n(2)Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition)', ' and (3)May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n(d)Permanent or long-term conditions. A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease. (e)Conditions requiring multiple treatments. Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, for:\n(1)Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury', ' or (2)A condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis (physical therapy), or kidney disease (dialysis).\n(f)Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section qualify for FMLA leave even though the employee or the covered family member does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee’s health care provider has advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness. 825.116Reserved 825.117Reserved 825.118Reserved 825.119Leave for treatment of substance abuse (a)Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of 825.113 through 825.115 are met. However, FMLA leave may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, absence because of the employee’s use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n(b)Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an employing office from taking employment action against an employee. The employing office may not take action against the employee because the employee has exercised his or her right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all employees, that provides under certain circumstances an employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also take FMLA leave to care for a covered family member who is receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office may not take action against an employee who is providing care for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance abuse. 825.120Leave for pregnancy or birth (a)General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave for pregnancy or birth of a son or daughter and to care for the newborn child as follows:\n(1)Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave for the birth of their child. (2)Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave to be with the healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding time) during the 12-month period beginning on the date of birth. An employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave for a birth expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth. If the employing office permits bonding leave to be taken beyond this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA leave. Under this section, both parents are entitled to FMLA leave even if the newborn does not have a serious health condition.\n(3)Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same employing office may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken for birth of the employee’s son or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care or to care for the child after placement, or to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where spouses both use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an additional six weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for a child with a serious health condition. (4)The expectant mother is entitled to FMLA leave for incapacity due to pregnancy, for prenatal care, or for her own serious health condition following the birth of the child. An expectant mother may take FMLA leave before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her condition makes her unable to work. The expectant mother is entitled to leave for incapacity due to pregnancy even though she does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last for more than three consecutive calendar days.\n(5)A spouse is entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care for a pregnant spouse who is incapacitated or if needed to care for her during her prenatal care, or if needed to care for her following the birth of a child if she has a serious health condition. See 825.124. (6)Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care for a child with a serious health condition if the requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and 825.122(d) are met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if needed to care for their newborn child with a serious health condition, even if both are employed by the same employing office, provided they have not exhausted their entitlements during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave period.\n(b)Intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An eligible employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after the birth to be with a healthy newborn child only if the employing office agrees. For example, an employing office and employee may agree to a part-time work schedule after the birth. If the employing office agrees to permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a child, the employing office may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee’s regular position. Transfer to an alternative position may require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement and Federal law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to an alternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee’s need for intermittent or reduced leave. The employing office’s agreement is not required for intermittent leave required by the serious health condition of the expectant mother or newborn child. See 825.202–825.205 for general rules governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for adoption or foster care. See 825.601 for special rules applicable to instructional employees of schools. 825.121Leave for adoption or foster care (a)General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave for placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child as follows:\n(1)Employees may take FMLA leave before the actual placement or adoption of a child if an absence from work is required for the placement for adoption or foster care to proceed. For example, the employee may be required to attend counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his or her attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth parent, submit to a physical examination, or travel to another country to complete an adoption. The source of an adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency or otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for leave for this purpose. (2)An employee’s entitlement to leave for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of the placement. If the employing office permits leave for adoption or foster care to be taken beyond this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA leave. Under this section, the employee is entitled to FMLA leave even if the adopted or foster child does not have a serious health condition.\n(3)Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same covered employing office may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken for the placement of the employee’s son or daughter or to care for the child after placement, for the birth of the employee’s son or daughter or to care for the child after birth, or to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where spouses both use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care for a healthy, newly placed child, each could use an additional six weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for a child with a serious health condition. (4)An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA leave in order to care for an adopted or foster child with a serious health condition if the requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and 825.122(d) are met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if needed to care for an adopted or foster child with a serious health condition, even if both are employed by the same employing office, provided they have not exhausted their entitlements during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave period.\n(b)Use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An eligible employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care only if the employing office agrees. Thus, for example, the employing office and employee may agree to a part-time work schedule after the placement for bonding purposes. If the employing office agrees to permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the placement for adoption or foster care, the employing office may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee’s regular position. Transfer to an alternative position may require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement and Federal law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to an alternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee’s need for intermittent or reduced leave. The employing office’s agreement is not required for intermittent leave required by the serious health condition of the adopted or foster child. See 825.202–825.205 for general rules governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. See 825.120 for general rules governing leave for pregnancy and birth of a child. See 825.601 for special rules applicable to instructional employees of schools. 825.122Definitions of covered servicemember, spouse, parent, son or daughter, next of kin of a covered servicemember, adoption, foster care, son or daughter on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, son or daughter of a covered servicemember, and parent of a covered servicemember (a)Covered servicemember means:\n(1)A current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness', ' or (2)A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness. Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. See 825.127(b)(2).\n(b)Spouse means a husband or wife. For purposes of this definition, husband or wife refers to the other person with whom an individual entered into marriage as defined or recognized under State law for purposes of marriage in the State in which the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside of any State, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered into and could have been entered into in at least one State. This definition includes an individual in a same-sex or common law marriage that either: (1)Was entered into in a State that recognizes such marriages', ' or\n(2)If entered into outside of any State, is valid in the place where entered into and could have been entered into in at least one State. (c)Parent. Parent means a biological, adoptive, step, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a son or daughter as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. This term does not include parents in law.\n(d)Son or daughter. For purposes of FMLA leave taken for birth or adoption, or to care for a family member with a serious health condition, son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence. (1)Incapable of self-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of the activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Activities of daily living include adaptive activities such as caring appropriately for one’s grooming and hygiene, bathing, dressing, and eating. Instrumental activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, using a post office, etc.\n(2)Physical or mental disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(h), (i), and (j), issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), provide guidance for these terms. (3)Persons who are in loco parentis include those with day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially support a child, or, in the case of an employee, who had such responsibility for the employee when the employee was a child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n(e)Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the nearest blood relative other than the covered servicemember’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the covered servicemember by court decree or statutory provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered servicemember has specifically designated in writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA. When no such designation is made, and there are multiple family members with the same level of relationship to the covered servicemember, all such family members shall be considered the covered servicemember’s next of kin and may take FMLA leave to provide care to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to be the covered servicemember’s only next of kin. See 825.127(d)(3). (f)Adoption means legally and permanently assuming the responsibility of raising a child as one’s own. The source of an adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency or otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for FMLA leave. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for adoption.\n(g)Foster care means 24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, and involves agreement between the State and foster family that the foster family will take care of the child. Although foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action is involved in the removal of the child from parental custody. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for foster care. (h)Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status means the employee’s biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and who is of any age. See 825.126(a)(5).\n(i)Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the covered servicemember’s biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. See 825.127(d)(1). (j)Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered servicemember’s biological, adoptive, step, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to the covered servicemember. This term does not include parents in law. See 825.127(d)(2).\n(k)Documenting relationships. For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, the employing office may require the employee giving notice of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or statement of family relationship. This documentation may take the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a child’s birth certificate, a court document, etc. The employing office is entitled to examine documentation such as a birth certificate, etc., but the employee is entitled to the return of the official document submitted for this purpose. 825.123Unable to perform the functions of the position (a)Definition. An employee is unable to perform the functions of the position where the health care provider finds that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any one of the essential functions of the employee’s position within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and made applicable by section 201(a) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions of the position during the absence for treatment.\n(b)Statement of functions. An employing office has the option, in requiring certification from a health care provider, to provide a statement of the essential functions of the employee’s position for the health care provider to review. A sufficient medical certification must specify what functions of the employee’s position the employee is unable to perform so that the employing office can then determine whether the employee is unable to perform one or more essential functions of the employee’s position. For purposes of the FMLA, the essential functions of the employee’s position are to be determined with reference to the position the employee held at the time notice is given or leave commenced, whichever is earlier. See 825.306. 825.124Needed to care for a family member or covered servicemember (a)The medical certification provision that an employee is needed to care for a family member or covered servicemember encompasses both physical and psychological care. It includes situations where, for example, because of a serious health condition, the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor. The term also includes providing psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care.\n(b)The term also includes situations where the employee may be needed to substitute for others who normally care for the family member or covered servicemember, or to make arrangements for changes in care, such as transfer to a nursing home. The employee need not be the only individual or family member available to care for the family member or covered servicemember. (c)An employee’s intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule necessary to care for a family member or covered servicemember includes not only a situation where the condition of the family member or covered servicemember itself is intermittent, but also where the employee is only needed intermittently—such as where other care is normally available, or care responsibilities are shared with another member of the family or a third party. See 825.202–825.205 for rules governing the use of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.\n825.125Definition of health care provider\n(a)The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, defines health care provider as: (1)A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in which the doctor practices', ' or\n(2)Any other person determined by the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights to be capable of providing health care services. (3)In making a determination referred to in subparagraph (a)(2), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights will follow any determination made by the Department of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of FMLA (29 U.S.C. 2611(6)(B))) that a person is capable of providing health care services, provided the determination by the Department of Labor was not made at the request of a person who was then a covered employee.\n(b)Others capable of providing health care services include only: (1)Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to practice in the State and performing within the scope of their practice as defined under State law', '\n(2)Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical social workers, and physician assistants who are authorized to practice under State law and who are performing within the scope of their practice as defined under State law', ' (3)Christian Science Practitioners listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts.

To address other events which arise out of the military member’s covered active duty or call to covered active duty status provided that the employing office and employee agree that such leave shall qualify as an exigency, and agree to both the timing and duration of such leave. 825.127Leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness (military caregiver leave) (a)Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious illness or injury.\n(b)Covered servicemember means: (1)A current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status', ' or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. Outpatient status means the status of a member of the Armed Forces assigned to either a military medical treatment facility as an outpatient or a unit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.\n(2)A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. An eligible employee must commence leave to care for a covered veteran within five years of the veteran’s active duty service, but the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may extend beyond the five-year period. (3)For an individual who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable prior to the effective date of this Final Rule, the period between October 28, 2009, and the effective date of this Final Rule shall not count towards the determination of the five-year period for covered veteran status.\n(c)A serious injury or illness means: (1)In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, means an injury or illness that was incurred by the covered servicemember in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces or that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces, and that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating', ' and\n(2)In the case of a covered veteran, means an injury or illness that was incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces), and manifested itself before or after the member became a veteran, and is: (A)A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember unable to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating', ' or\n(B)A physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a Department of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater, and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the condition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave', ' or (C)A physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the covered veteran’s ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so absent treatment', ' or \n(D)An injury, including a psychological injury, on the basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. (d)In order to care for a covered servicemember, an eligible employee must be the spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember.\n(1)Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the covered servicemember’s biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. (2)Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered servicemember’s biological, adoptive, step, or foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis to the covered servicemember. This term does not include parents in law.\n(3)Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the nearest blood relative, other than the covered servicemember’s spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody of the servicemember by court decree or statutory provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered servicemember has specifically designated in writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA. When no such designation is made, and there are multiple family members with the same level of relationship to the covered servicemember, all such family members shall be considered the covered servicemember’s next of kin and may take FMLA leave to provide care to the covered servicemember, either consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to be the covered servicemember’s only next of kin. For example, if a covered servicemember has three siblings and has not designated a blood relative to provide care, all three siblings would be considered the covered servicemember’s next of kin. Alternatively, where a covered servicemember has a sibling(s) and designates a cousin as his or her next of kin for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is eligible as the covered servicemember’s next of kin. An employing office is permitted to require an employee to provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the covered servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k). (e)An eligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness during a single 12–month period.\n(1)The single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this section begins on the first day the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12 months after that date, regardless of the method used by the employing office to determine the employee’s 12 workweeks of leave entitlement for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an eligible employee does not take all of his or her 26 workweeks of leave entitlement to care for a covered servicemember during this single 12-month period, the remaining part of his or her 26 workweeks of leave entitlement to care for the covered servicemember is forfeited. (2)The leave entitlement described in paragraph (e) of this section is to be applied on a per-covered-servicemember, per-injury basis such that an eligible employee may be entitled to take more than one period of 26 workweeks of leave if the leave is to care for different covered servicemembers or to care for the same servicemember with a subsequent serious injury or illness, except that no more than 26 workweeks of leave may be taken within any single 12-month period. An eligible employee may take more than one period of 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered servicemember with more than one serious injury or illness only when the serious injury or illness is a subsequent serious injury or illness. When an eligible employee takes leave to care for more than one covered servicemember or for a subsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered servicemember, and the single 12-month periods corresponding to the different military caregiver leave entitlements overlap, the employee is limited to taking no more than 26 workweeks of leave in each single 12-month period.\n(3)An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave for any FMLA-qualifying reason during the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this section, provided that the employee is entitled to no more than 12 workweeks of leave for one or more of the following: in connection with the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and in order to care for such son or daughter', ' in connection with the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care', ' in order to care for the spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition', ' because of the employee’s own serious health condition', ' or because of a qualifying exigency. Thus, for example, an eligible employee may, during the single 12-month period, take 16 workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and 10 workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. However, the employee may not take more than 12 weeks of FMLA leave to care for the newborn child during the single 12-month period, even if the employee takes fewer than 14 workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember. (4)In all circumstances, including for leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, the employing office is responsible for designating leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to the employee as provided in 825.300. In the case of leave that qualifies as both leave to care for a covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition during the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this section, the employing office must designate such leave as leave to care for a covered servicemember in the first instance. Leave that qualifies as both leave to care for a covered servicemember and leave taken to care for a family member with a serious health condition during the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this section must not be designated and counted as both leave to care for a covered servicemember and leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition. As is the case with leave taken for other qualifying reasons, employing offices may retroactively designate leave as leave to care for a covered servicemember pursuant to 825.301(d).\n(f)Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same covered employing office may be limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this section if the leave is taken for birth of the employee’s son or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after placement, to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses are employed at two different worksites. On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 26 workweeks of FMLA leave. BEmployee Leave Entitlements Under The Family And Medical Leave Act, As Made Applicable By The Congressional Accountability Act 825.200Amount of leave (a)Except in the case of leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, an eligible employee’s FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:\n(1)The birth of the employee’s son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child', ' (2)The placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed child', '\n(3)To care for the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition', ' (4)Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his or her job', ' and\n(5)Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty). (b)An employing office is permitted to choose any one of the following methods for determining the 12-month period in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement described in paragraph (a) of this section occurs:\n(1)The calendar year', ' (2)Any fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year or a year starting on an employee’s anniversary date', '\n(3)The 12-month period measured forward from the date any employee’s first FMLA leave under paragraph (a) begins', ' or (4)A rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave as described in paragraph (a).\n(c)Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is taken', ' the next 12-month period would begin the first time FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the rolling 12-month period, each time an employee takes FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee used four weeks beginning February 1, 2008, four weeks beginning June 1, 2008, and four weeks beginning December 1, 2008, the employee would not be entitled to any additional leave until February 1, 2009. However, beginning on February 1, 2009, the employee would again be eligible to take FMLA leave, recouping the right to take the leave in the same manner and amounts in which it was used in the previous year. Thus, the employee would recoup (and be entitled to use) one additional day of FMLA leave each day for four weeks, commencing February 1, 2009. The employee would also begin to recoup additional days beginning on June 1, 2009, and additional days beginning on December 1, 2009. Accordingly, employing offices using the rolling 12-month period may need to calculate whether the employee is entitled to take FMLA leave each time that leave is requested, and employees taking FMLA leave on such a basis may fall in and out of FMLA protection based on their FMLA usage in the prior 12 months. For example, in the example above, if the employee needs six weeks of leave for a serious health condition commencing February 1, 2009, only the first four weeks of the leave would be FMLA-protected. (d) (1)Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for the leave entitlements described in paragraph (a) of this section provided the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees. An employing office wishing to change to another alternative is required to give at least 60 days’ notice to all employees, and the transition must take place in such a way that the employees retain the full benefit of 12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances may a new method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA’s FMLA leave requirements.\n(2)Reserved (e)If an employing office fails to select one of the options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the 12-month period for the leave entitlements described in paragraph (a), the option that provides the most beneficial outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-day notice to all employees of the option the employing office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the option providing the most beneficial outcome to that employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the employing office may implement the selected option.\n(f)An eligible employee’s FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. An employing office shall determine the single 12- month period in which the 26 weeks of leave entitlement described in this paragraph occurs using the 12-month period measured forward from the date an employee’s first FMLA leave to care for the covered servicemember begins. See 825.127(e)(1).  (g)During the single 12-month period described in paragraph (f), an eligible employee’s FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of FMLA leave for any qualifying reason. See 825.127(e)(3).\n(h)For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the week taken as FMLA leave has no effect', ' the week is counted as a week of FMLA leave. However, if an employee is using FMLA leave in increments of less than one week, the holiday will not count against the employee’s FMLA entitlement unless the employee was otherwise scheduled and expected to work during the holiday. Similarly, if for some reason the employing office’s business activity has temporarily ceased and employees generally are not expected to report for work for one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for the Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an employing office closing the office for repairs), the days the employing office’s activities have ceased do not count against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for determining an employee’s 12-week leave entitlement are also described in 825.205. (i) (1)If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and if they designate a primary employing office pursuant to 825.106(c), the primary employing office may choose any one of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees of the primary employing office including the jointly employed employee.\n(2)If employing offices fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to 825.106(c), an employee jointly employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of the employing offices, select that employing office to be the primary employing office of the employee for purposes of the application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. (j)If, before beginning employment with an employing office, an employee had been employed by another employing office, the subsequent employing office may count against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement FMLA leave taken from the prior employing office, so long as the prior employing office properly designated the leave as FMLA under these regulations or other applicable requirements.\n825.201Leave to care for a parent\n(a)General rule. An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition. Care for parents-in-law is not covered by the FMLA. See 825.122(c) for definition of parent. (b)Same employing office limitation. Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same covered employing office may be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken to care for the employee’s parent with a serious health condition, for the birth of the employee’s son or daughter or to care for the child after the birth, or for placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care or to care for the child after placement. This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where the spouses both use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care for a parent, each could use an additional six weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for a child with a serious health condition. See also 825.127(d).\n825.202Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule\n(a)Definition. FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee’s usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee’s schedule for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time. (b)Medical necessity. For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule taken because of one’s own serious health condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or daughter with a serious health condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, there must be a medical need for leave and it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The treatment regimen and other information described in the certification of a serious health condition and in the certification of a serious injury or illness, if required by the employing office, addresses the medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule. See 825.306, 825.310. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical treatment of a serious health condition or of a covered servicemember’s serious injury or illness, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a serious health condition or a covered servicemember’s serious injury or illness. It may also be taken to provide care or psychological comfort to a covered family member with a serious health condition or a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\n(1)Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health condition of a spouse, parent, son, or daughter, for the employee’s own serious health condition, or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember which requires treatment by a health care provider periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, and may include leave of periods from an hour or more to several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave would include leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments, or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of six months, such as for chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced leave schedule is an employee who is recovering from a serious health condition and is not strong enough to work a full-time schedule. (2)Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated or unable to perform the essential functions of the position because of a chronic serious health condition or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, even if he or she does not receive treatment by a health care provider. See 825.113 and 825.127.\n(c)Birth or placement. When leave is taken after the birth of a healthy child or placement of a healthy child for adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing office’s agreement, works part-time after the birth of a child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing office’s agreement is not required, however, for leave during which the expectant mother has a serious health condition in connection with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a serious health condition. See 825.204 for rules governing transfer to an alternative position that better accommodates intermittent leave. See also 825.120 (pregnancy) and 825.121 (adoption and foster care). (d)Qualifying exigency. Leave due to a qualifying exigency may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis.\n825.203Scheduling of intermittent or reduced schedule leaveEligible employees may take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary due to the serious health condition of a covered family member or the employee or the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember. See 825.202. Eligible employees may also take FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis when necessary because of a qualifying exigency. If an employee needs leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical treatment, then the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employing office’s operations. 825.204Transfer of an employee to an alternative position during intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave (a)Transfer or reassignment. If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment for the employee, a family member, or a covered servicemember, including during a period of recovery from one’s own serious health condition, a serious health condition of a spouse, parent, son, or daughter, or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, or if the employing office agrees to permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, the employing office may require the employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee’s regular position. See 825.601 for special rules applicable to instructional employees of schools.\n(b)Compliance. Transfer to an alternative position may require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining agreement and Federal law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to an alternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee’s need for intermittent or reduced scheduled leave. (c)Equivalent pay and benefits. The alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits. An alternative position for these purposes does not have to have equivalent duties. The employing office may increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative position, so as to make them equivalent to the pay and benefits of the employee’s regular job. The employing office may also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the same hourly rate of pay and benefits, provided the employee is not required to take more leave than is medically necessary. For example, an employee desiring to take leave in increments of four hours per day could be transferred to a half-time job, or could remain in the employee’s same job on a part-time schedule, paying the same hourly rate as the employee’s previous job and enjoying the same benefits. The employing office may not eliminate benefits which otherwise would not be provided to part-time employees', ' however, an employing office may proportionately reduce benefits such as vacation leave where an employing office’s normal practice is to base such benefits on the number of hours worked. \n(d)Employing office limitations. An employing office may not transfer the employee to an alternative position in order to discourage the employee from taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee. For example, a white collar employee may not be assigned to perform laborer’s work', ' an employee working the day shift may not be reassigned to the graveyard shift', ' an employee working in the headquarters facility may not be reassigned to a branch a significant distance away from the employee’s normal job location. Any such attempt on the part of the employing office to make such a transfer will be held to be contrary to the prohibited acts provisions of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. (e)Reinstatement of employee. When an employee who is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule and has been transferred to an alternative position no longer needs to continue on leave and is able to return to full-time work, the employee must be placed in the same or equivalent job as the job he or she left when the leave commenced. An employee may not be required to take more leave than necessary to address the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave.\n825.205Increments of fmla leave for intermittent or reduced schedule leave\n(a)Minimum increment. (1)When an employee takes FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, the employing office must account for the leave using an increment no greater than the shortest period of time that the employing office uses to account for use of other forms of leave provided that it is not greater than one hour and provided further that an employee’s FMLA leave entitlement may not be reduced by more than the amount of leave actually taken. An employing office may not require an employee to take more leave than is necessary to address the circumstances that precipitated the need for the leave, provided that the leave is counted using the shortest increment of leave used to account for any other type of leave. See also 825.205(a)(2) for the physical impossibility exception, and 825.600 and 825.601 for special rules applicable to employees of schools. If an employing office uses different increments to account for different types of leave, the employing office must account for FMLA leave in the smallest increment used to account for any other type of leave. For example, if an employing office accounts for the use of annual leave in increments of one hour and the use of sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave use must be accounted for using increments no larger than one-half hour. If an employing office accounts for use of leave in varying increments at different times of the day or shift, the employing office may also account for FMLA leave in varying increments, provided that the increment used for FMLA leave is no greater than the smallest increment used for any other type of leave during the period in which the FMLA leave is taken. If an employing office accounts for other forms of leave use in increments greater than one hour, the employing office must account for FMLA leave use in increments no greater than one hour. An employing office may account for FMLA leave in shorter increments than used for other forms of leave. For example, an employing office that accounts for other forms of leave in one hour increments may account for FMLA leave in a shorter increment when the employee arrives at work several minutes late, and the employing office wants the employee to begin work immediately. Such accounting for FMLA leave will not alter the increment considered to be the shortest period used to account for other forms of leave or the use of FMLA leave in other circumstances. In all cases, employees may not be charged FMLA leave for periods during which they are working.\n(2)Where it is physically impossible for an employee using intermittent leave or working a reduced leave schedule to commence or end work mid-way through a shift, such as where a flight attendant or a railroad conductor is scheduled to work aboard an airplane or train, or a laboratory employee is unable to enter or leave a sealed clean room during a certain period of time and no equivalent position is available, the entire period that the employee is forced to be absent is designated as FMLA leave and counts against the employee’s FMLA entitlement. The period of the physical impossibility is limited to the period during which the employing office is unable to permit the employee to work prior to a period of FMLA leave or return the employee to the same or equivalent position due to the physical impossibility after a period of FMLA leave. See 825.214. (b)Calculation of leave.\n(1)When an employee takes leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted toward the employee’s leave entitlement. The actual workweek is the basis of leave entitlement. Therefore, if an employee who would otherwise work 40 hours a week takes off eight hours, the employee would use one-fifth (1/5) of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, if a full-time employee who would otherwise work eight-hour days works four-hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee would use one half (1/2) week of FMLA leave each week. Where an employee works a part-time schedule or variable hours, the amount of FMLA leave that an employee uses is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis. If an employee who would otherwise work 30 hours per week, but works only 20 hours a week under a reduced leave schedule, the employee’s 10 hours of leave would constitute one-third (1/3) of a week of FMLA leave for each week the employee works the reduced leave schedule. An employing office may convert these fractions to their hourly equivalent so long as the conversion equitably reflects the employee’s total normally scheduled hours. An employee does not accrue FMLA-protected leave at any particular hourly rate. An eligible employee is entitled to up to a total of 12 workweeks of leave, or 26 workweeks in the case of military caregiver leave, and the total number of hours contained in those workweeks is necessarily dependent on the specific hours the employee would have worked but for the use of leave. See also 825.601 and 825.602 on special rules for schools.  (2)If an employing office has made a permanent or long-term change in the employee’s schedule (for reasons other than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for making this calculation.\n(3)If an employee’s schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that an employing office is unable to determine with any certainty how many hours the employee would otherwise have worked (but for the taking of FMLA leave), a weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 months prior to the beginning of the leave period (including any hours for which the employee took leave of any type) would be used for calculating the employee’s leave entitlement. (c)Overtime. If an employee would normally be required to work overtime, but is unable to do so because of a FMLA-qualifying reason that limits the employee’s ability to work overtime, the hours which the employee would have been required to work may be counted against the employee’s FMLA entitlement. In such a case, the employee is using intermittent or reduced schedule leave. For example, if an employee would normally be required to work for 48 hours in a particular week, but due to a serious health condition the employee is unable to work more than 40 hours that week, the employee would utilize eight hours of FMLA-protected leave out of the 48-hour workweek, or one-sixth (1/6) of a week of FMLA leave. Voluntary overtime hours that an employee does not work due to an FMLA-qualifying reason may not be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. \n825.206Interaction with the FLSA, as made applicable by the congressional accountability act\n(a)Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, and as exempt under regulations issued by the Board, at part 541, providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. This means that under regulations currently in effect, where an employee meets the specified duties test, is paid on a salary basis, and is paid a salary of at least the amount specified in the regulations, the employing office may make deductions from the employee’s salary for any hours taken as intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a workweek, without affecting the exempt status of the employee. (b)For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the employee works, including time and one-half the employee’s regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an hourly basis would include the entire period during which the employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined by dividing the employee’s weekly salary by the employee’s normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing office does not elect to convert the employee’s compensation to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a fluctuating workweek basis.\n(c)This special exception to the salary basis requirements of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek payment requirements applies only to employees of covered employing offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which qualifies as FMLA leave. Hourly or other deductions which are not in accordance with the Board’s FLSA regulations at part 541 or with a permissible fluctuating workweek method of payment for overtime may not be taken, for example, where the employee has not worked long enough to be eligible for FMLA leave without potentially affecting the employee’s eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions which are not permitted by the Board’s FLSA regulations at part 541 or by a permissible fluctuating workweek method of payment for overtime be taken from such an employee’s salary for any leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for example, deductions from an employee’s pay for leave required under an employing office’s policy or practice for a reason which does not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for a grandparent or for a medical condition which does not qualify as a serious health condition or serious injury or illness', ' or for leave which is more generous than provided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. Employing offices may comply with the employing office’s own policy/practice under these circumstances and maintain the employee’s eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from the employee’s pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, as made applicable by the CAA, or may take such deductions, treating the employee as an hourly employee and pay overtime premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. 825.207Substitution of paid leave, generally (a)Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid leave. However, under the circumstances described in this section, the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. Subject to 825.208, if an employee does not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the employing office may require the employee to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. The term substitute means that the paid leave provided by the employing office, and accrued pursuant to established policies of the employing office, will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave. Accordingly, the employee receives pay pursuant to the employing office’s applicable paid leave policy during the period of otherwise unpaid FMLA leave. An employee’s ability to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms and conditions of the employing office’s normal leave policy. When an employee chooses, or an employing office requires, substitution of accrued paid leave, the employing office must inform the employee that the employee must satisfy any procedural requirements of the paid leave policy only in connection with the receipt of such payment. See 825.300(c). If an employee does not comply with the additional requirements in an employing office’s paid leave policy, the employee is not entitled to substitute accrued paid leave, but the employee remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave. Employing offices may not discriminate against employees on FMLA leave in the administration of their paid leave policies.\n(b)If neither the employee nor the employing office elects to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued under the terms of the employing office’s plan. (c)If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. For example, paid sick leave used for a medical condition which is not a serious health condition or serious injury or illness does not count against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.\n(d)Leave taken pursuant to a disability leave plan would be considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and counted in the leave entitlement permitted under FMLA if it meets the criteria set forth above in 825.112 through 825.115. In such cases, the employing office may designate the leave as FMLA leave and count the leave against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Because leave pursuant to a disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the provision for substitution of the employee’s accrued paid leave is inapplicable, and neither the employee nor the employing office may require the substitution of paid leave. However, employing offices and employees may agree to have paid leave supplement the disability plan benefits, such as in the case where a plan only provides replacement income for two-thirds of an employee’s salary. (e)The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, provides that a serious health condition may result from injury to the employee on or off the job. If the employing office designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with 825.300(d), the leave counts against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Because the workers’ compensation absence is not unpaid, the provision for substitution of the employee’s accrued paid leave is not applicable, and neither the employee nor the employing office may require the substitution of paid leave. However, employing offices and employees may agree, to have paid leave supplement workers’ compensation benefits, such as in the case where workers’ compensation only provides replacement income for two-thirds of an employee’s salary. If the health care provider treating the employee for the workers’ compensation injury certifies the employee is able to return to a light duty job but is unable to return to the same or equivalent job, the employee may decline the employing office’s offer of a light duty job. As a result, the employee may lose workers’ compensation payments, but is entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave until the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted. As of the date workers’ compensation benefits cease, the substitution provision becomes applicable and either the employee may elect or the employing office may require the use of accrued paid leave. See also 825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), 825.307(a) and 825.702 (d)(1) and (2) regarding the relationship between workers’ compensation absences and FMLA leave.\n(f)Under the FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA, an employing office always has the right to cash out an employee’s compensatory time or to require the employee to use the time. Therefore, if an employee requests and is permitted to use accrued compensatory time to receive pay for time taken off for an FMLA reason, or if the employing office requires such use pursuant to the FLSA, the time taken may be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. 825.208Substitution of paid leave—special rule for paid parental leave (a)This section applies to births or placements occurring on or after October 1, 2020.\n(b)This section provides the basis for determining the periods of unpaid leave for which paid parental leave or accrued paid leave may be substituted in connection with: (1)The birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child (See 825.120)', ' or\n(2)The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care and the care of such son or daughter (See 825.121)', ' (c)Leave connected to birth or placement. For unpaid leave described in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee may elect to substitute—\n(1)Up to 12 workweeks of paid parental leave in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement, and (2)Any additional paid annual, vacation, personal, family, medical, or sick leave provided by the employing office to such employee.\n(d)Leave entitlement. Since an employee may use only 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in any 12-month period under 825.200(a), any use of unpaid FMLA leave not associated with paid parental leave may affect an employee’s ability to use the full 12 weeks of paid parental leave within a single 12-month period. The specific amount of paid parental leave available will depend on when the employee uses various types of unpaid FMLA leave relative to any 12-month period established under 825.200(b). (e)Employee entitlement to substitute.\n(1)An employee is entitled to substitute paid leave for leave without pay as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. (2)An employing office may not require that an employee first use all or any portion of the leave described in subparagraph (c)(2) of this section before being allowed to use the leave described in subparagraph (c)(1) of this section.\n(3)An employing office may not require an employee to substitute paid leave for leave without pay as described in subparagraph (c)(2) of this section. (4)An employee may request to use annual, vacation, personal, family, medical, or sick leave for the reasons described in paragraph (b) of this section without invoking family and medical leave, and, in that case, the employing office exercises its normal authority with respect to approving or disapproving the timing of when the leave may be used. If the employing office grants the leave request, it must designate whether any leave granted is FMLA leave, in accordance with sections 825.300 and 825.301.\n(f)Notification by employee and retroactive substitution. (1)An employee must notify the employing office of the employee’s election to substitute paid leave for leave without pay under this section prior to the date such paid leave commences (i.e., no retroactive substitution), except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, and provided such retroactive substitution does not violate any applicable law or regulation.\n(2)An employee may retroactively substitute paid leave for leave without pay as permitted in paragraph (c) of this section, if the substitution is made in conjunction with the retroactive granting of leave without pay. (3)An employee may retroactively substitute transferred (donated) annual leave for leave without pay granted under this subpart.\n(g)Pay during leave. The pay an employee receives when using paid parental leave shall be the same pay the employee would receive if the employee were using annual leave. (h)Treatment of unused leave. If an employee has any unused balance of paid parental leave that remains at the end of the 12-month period following the birth or placement involved, the entitlement to the unused leave elapses at that time. No payment may be made for unused paid parental leave that has expired. Paid parental leave may not be considered annual leave for purposes of making a lump-sum payment for annual leave or for any other purpose. The forfeiture of any unused balance of paid parental leave does not impact an employee’s ability to use unpaid FMLA leave for other qualifying reasons, if eligible pursuant to 825.110, 825.112 and 825.200.\n(i)Employing office responsibilities. An employing office that has employees covered by this subpart is responsible for the proper administration of 825.208, including the responsibility of informing employees of their entitlements and obligations. (j)Library of Congress. The OCWR will defer to supplemental regulations on paid parental leave issued by the Library of Congress pursuant to the authority in section 107 of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, provided those supplemental regulations are consistent with the regulations in this subpart.\n(k)Work obligation. Paid parental leave under this subpart shall apply without regard to: (1)the limitations in subparagraphs (E), (F), or (G) of section 6382(d)(2) of title 5, United States Code (requiring employees of executive branch agencies to agree in writing to work for the executive branch agency for at least 12 months after returning from leave)', ' or\n(2)the limitations in 825.213 (permitting employing offices to recover an amount equal to the total amount of government contributions for maintaining such employee’s health coverage if the employee fails to return from leave). (l)Cases of employee incapacitation.\n(1)If an employing office determines that an otherwise eligible employee who could have made an election for a past leave period to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in paragraph (c) of this section) was physically or mentally incapable of doing so during that past period, the employee may, within 5 workdays of the employee’s return to duty status, make an election to substitute paid parental leave for applicable unpaid FMLA leave under paragraph (c) of this section on a retroactive basis, provided such retroactive substitution does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Such a retroactive election shall be effective on the date that such an election would have been effective if the employee had not been incapacitated at the time. (2)If an employing office learns that an otherwise eligible employee is physically or mentally incapable of making an election to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in 825.207), the employing office must, upon the request of a personal representative of the employee, provide conditional approval of substitution of paid parental leave for applicable unpaid FMLA leave on a prospective basis. The conditional approval is based on the presumption that the employee would have elected to substitute paid parental leave for the applicable unpaid FMLA leave. An employee may, within 5 workdays of the employee’s return to duty status, request to substitute other leave for the paid parental leave.\n(m)Cases of multiple children born or placed in the same time period.  (1)If an employee has multiple children born or placed on the same day, the multiple-child birth/placement event is considered to be a single event that triggers a single entitlement of up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave under paragraph (d) of this section.\n(2)If an employee has one or more children born or placed during the 12-month period following the date of an earlier birth or placement of a child of the employee, the provisions of this subpart shall be independently administered for each birth or placement event. 825.209Maintenance of employee benefits (a)During any FMLA leave, an employing office must maintain the employee’s coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health coverage. The definition of group health plan is set forth in 825.102. For purposes of FMLA, the term group health plan shall not include an insurance program providing health coverage under which employees purchase individual policies from insurers provided that:\n(1)No contributions are made by the employing office', ' (2)Participation in the program is completely voluntary for employees', '\n(3)The sole functions of the employing office with respect to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the insurer', ' (4)The employing office receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for administrative services actually rendered in connection with payroll deduction', ' and\n(5)The premium charged with respect to such coverage does not increase in the event the employment relationship terminates. (b)The same group health plan benefits provided to an employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is provided to an employee, family member coverage must be maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during leave if provided in an employing office’s group health plan, including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not provided through a flexible spending account or other component of a cafeteria plan.\n(c)If an employing office provides a new health plan or benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing office changes a group health plan so that dental care becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave must be given the same opportunity as other employees to receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) which apply to all employees of the workforce would also apply to an employee on FMLA leave. (d)Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group health plan permits an employee to change from single to family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add new family members, such a change in benefits must be made available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the employing office.\n(e)An employee may choose not to retain group health plan coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See 825.212(c). (f)Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable, and for key employees (as discussed below), an employing office’s obligation to maintain health benefits during leave (and to restore the employee to the same or equivalent employment) under FMLA ceases if and when the employment relationship would have terminated if the employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if the employee’s position is eliminated as part of a nondiscriminatory reduction in force and the employee would not have been transferred to another position)', ' an employee informs the employing office of his or her intent not to return from leave (including before starting the leave if the employing office is so informed before the leave starts)', ' or the employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-month period.\n(g)If a key employee (See 825.218) does not return from leave when notified by the employing office that substantial or grievous economic injury will result from his or her reinstatement, the employee’s entitlement to group health plan benefits continues unless and until the employee advises the employing office that the employee does not desire restoration to employment at the end of the leave period, or the FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or reinstatement is actually denied. (h)An employee’s entitlement to benefits other than group health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday pay) is to be determined by the employing office’s established policy for providing such benefits when the employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as appropriate).\n825.210Employee payment of group health benefit premiums\n(a)Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the same basis as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of health insurance policies which are not a part of the employing office’s group health plan, as described in 825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. The employee and the insurer should make necessary arrangements for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. (b)If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the employee’s share of premiums must be paid by the method normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll deduction.\n(c)If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. The employing office may require that payment be made to the employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no additional charge may be added to the employee’s premium payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may require employees to pay their share of premium payments in any of the following ways: (1)Payment would be due at the same time as it would be made if by payroll deduction', '\n(2)Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable', ' (3)Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan at the employee’s option', '\n(4)The employing office’s existing rules for payment by employees on leave without pay would be followed, provided that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., prior to the commencement of the leave) of the premiums that will become due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or payment of higher premiums than if the employee had continued to work instead of taking leave', ' or (5)Another system voluntarily agreed to between the employing office and the employee, which may include prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n(d)The employing office must provide the employee with advance written notice of the terms and conditions under which these payments must be made. See 825.300(c). (e)An employing office may not require more of an employee using unpaid FMLA leave than the employing office requires of other employees on leave without pay.\n(f)An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a workers’ compensation injury must make arrangements with the employing office for payment of group health plan benefits when simultaneously taking FMLA leave. See 825.207(e). 825.211Maintenance of benefits under multi-employer health plans (a)A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more than one employing office is required to contribute, and which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employee organization(s) and the employing offices.\n(b)An employing office under a multi-employer plan must continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions by all employing offices party to the plan. (c)During the duration of an employee’s FMLA leave, coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n(d)An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use banked hours or pay a greater premium than the employee would have been required to pay if the employee had been continuously employed. (e)As provided in 825.209(f) of this part, group health plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA leave until:\n(1)The employee’s FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted', ' (2)The employing office can show that the employee would have been laid off and the employment relationship terminated', ' or\n(3)The employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work. 825.212Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments (a) (1)In the absence of an established employing office policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office’s obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under FMLA if an employee’s premium payment is more than 30 days late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose premium payment is late, the employing office must provide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received by that date. If the employing office has established policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n(2)An employing office has no obligation regarding the maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a group health plan. See 825.209(a). (3)All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA would continue', ' for example, the employing office continues to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return from leave.\n(b)The employing office may recover the employee’s share of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA leave period during which the employing office maintains health coverage by paying the employee’s share after the premium payment is missed. (c)If coverage lapses because an employee has not made required premium payments, upon the employee’s return from FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or dependent coverage. See 825.215(d)(1)–(5). In such case, an employee may not be required to meet any qualification requirements imposed by the plan, including any new preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain reinstatement of coverage. If an employing office terminates an employee’s insurance in accordance with this section and fails to restore the employee’s health insurance as required by this section upon the employee’s return, the employing office may be liable for benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable relief tailored to the harm suffered.\n825.213Employing office recovery of benefit costs\n(a)In addition to the circumstances discussed in 825.212(b), and subject to the exceptions provided in 825.208(k), an employing office may recover its share of health plan premiums during a period of unpaid FMLA leave from an employee if the employee fails to return to work after the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted or expires, unless the reason the employee does not return is due to: (1)The continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s family member, or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, which would otherwise entitle the employee to leave under FMLA', ' or\n(2)Other circumstances beyond the employee’s control. Examples of other circumstances beyond the employee’s control are necessarily broad. They include such situations as where a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child who has a serious health condition', ' an employee’s spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles from the employee’s worksite', ' a relative or individual other than a covered family member has a serious health condition and the employee is needed to provide care', ' the employee is laid off while on leave', ' or, the employee is a key employee who decides not to return to work upon being notified of the employing office’s intention to deny restoration because of substantial and grievous economic injury to the employing office’s operations and is not reinstated by the employing office. Other circumstances beyond the employee’s control would not include a situation where an employee desires to remain with a parent in a distant city even though the parent no longer requires the employee’s care, or a parent chooses not to return to work to stay home with a well, newborn child. (3)When an employee fails to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a serious health condition of the employee or employee’s family member, or a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, thereby precluding the employing office from recovering its (share of) health benefit premium payments made on the employee’s behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the employing office may require medical certification of the employee’s or the family member’s serious health condition or the covered servicemember’s serious injury or illness. Such certification is not required unless requested by the employing office. The cost of the certification shall be borne by the employee, and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification. The employee is required to provide medical certification in a timely manner which, for purposes of this section, is within 30 days from the date of the employing office’s request. For purposes of medical certification, the employee may use the optional forms developed for this purpose. See 825.306(b), 825.310(c)–(d) and Forms A, B, and F. If the employing office requests medical certification and the employee does not provide such certification in a timely manner (within 30 days), or the reason for not returning to work does not meet the test of other circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the employing office may recover 100 percent of the health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid FMLA leave.\n(b)Under some circumstances an employing office may elect to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability insurance, etc., by paying the employee’s (share of) premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee’s share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to work. (c)An employee who returns to work for at least 30 calendar days is considered to have returned to work. An employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n(d)When an employee elects or an employing office requires paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including workers’ compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave. (e)The amount that self-insured employing offices may recover is limited to only the employing office’s share of allowable premiums as would be calculated under COBRA, excluding the two percent fee for administrative costs.\n(f)When an employee fails to return to work, any health and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. The existence of this debt caused by the employee’s failure to return to work does not alter the employing office’s responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the employing office may recover the costs through deduction from any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the employing office may initiate legal action against the employee to recover such costs. 825.214Employee right to reinstatementGeneral Rule. On return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to be returned to the same position the employee held when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. An employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the employee has been replaced or his or her position has been restructured to accommodate the employee’s absence. See also 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices that are joint employers.\n825.215Equivalent position\n(a)Equivalent position. An equivalent position is one that is virtually identical to the employee’s former position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, prerequisites, and status. It must involve the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority. (b)Conditions to qualify. If an employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee’s inability to attend a necessary course, renew a license, etc., as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon return to work.\n(c)Equivalent Pay.  (1)An employee is entitled to any unconditional pay increases which may have occurred during the FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay increases conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or work performed must be granted in accordance with the employing office’s policy or practice with respect to other employees on an equivalent leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA leave.\n(2)Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or non-discretionary, made to employees consistent with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, if a bonus or other payment is based on the achievement of a specified goal such as hours worked, products sold or perfect attendance, and the employee has not met the goal due to FMLA leave, then the payment may be denied, unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA leave. For example, if an employee who used paid vacation leave for a non-FMLA purpose would receive the payment, then the employee who used paid vacation leave for an FMLA-protected purpose also must receive the payment. (d)Equivalent benefits. Benefits include all benefits provided or made available to employees by an employing office, including group life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing office through an employee benefit plan.\n(1)At the end of an employee’s FMLA leave, benefits must be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of FMLA leave affecting the entire work force, unless otherwise elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay these costs subject to recovery from the employee on return from leave. See 825.213(b). (2)An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee upon return from leave.\n(3)If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing office is required to follow established policies or practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of leave without pay. If the employing office has no established policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins. (4)With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and eligibility to participate.\n(5)Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, 825.209 addresses health benefits.) (e)Equivalent terms and conditions of employment. An equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, conditions, responsibilities, privileges, and status as the employee’s original position.\n(1)The employee must be reinstated to the same or a geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) from where the employee had previously been employed. If the employee’s original worksite has been closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an employing office transfers all employees from a closed worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed. (2)The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n(3)The employee must have the same or an equivalent opportunity for bonuses, and other similar discretionary and non-discretionary payments. (4)FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from accommodating an employee’s request to be restored to a different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the employee’s personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot be induced by the employing office to accept a different position against the employee’s wishes.\n(f)De minimis exception. The requirement that an employee be restored to the same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not extend to de minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable aspects of the job. 825.216Limitations on an employee’s right to reinstatement (a)An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period. An employing office must be able to show that an employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment. For example:\n(1)If an employee is laid off during the course of taking FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing office’s responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing office has no continuing obligations under a collective bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would have the burden of proving that an employee would have been laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would not be entitled to restoration. Restoration to a job slated for lay-off when the employee’s original position is not would not meet the requirements of an equivalent position. (2)If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to work that shift or the original overtime hours upon restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before taking FMLA leave.\n(3)If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term or project is over and the employing office would not otherwise have continued to employ the employee. On the other hand, if an employee was hired to perform work for one employing office for a specific time period, and after that time period has ended, the work was assigned to another employing office, the successor employing office may be required to restore the employee if it is a successor employing office. (b)In addition to the circumstances explained above, an employing office may deny job restoration to salaried eligible employees (key employees, as defined in 825.217(c)), if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employing office', ' or may delay restoration to an employee who fails to provide a fitness-for-duty certificate to return to work under the conditions described in 825.312.\n(c)If the employee is unable to perform an essential function of the position because of a physical or mental condition, including the continuation of a serious health condition or an injury or illness also covered by workers’ compensation, the employee has no right to restoration to another position under the FMLA. The employing office’s obligations may, however, be governed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by the CAA. See 825.702. (d)An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an employing office is not protected by the job restoration or maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA.\n(e)If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An employing office which does not have such a policy may not deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, on this basis unless the FMLA leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (d) of this section.  825.217Key employee, general rule (a)A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite.\n(b)The term salaried means paid on a salary basis, within the meaning of the Board’s FLSA regulations at part 541, implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA. (c)A key employee must be among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees—both salaried and non-salaried, eligible and ineligible—who are employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the worksite.\n(1)In determining which employees are among the highest paid 10 percent, year-to-date earnings are divided by weeks worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined at some future date, e.g., benefits or prerequisites. (2)The determination of whether a salaried employee is among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than 10 percent of the employing office’s employees within 75 miles of the worksite may be key employees.\n825.218Substantial and grievous economic injury\n(a)In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an employing office must determine that the restoration of the employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employing office, not whether the absence of the employee will cause such substantial and grievous injury. (b)An employing office may take into account its ability to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous economic injury will occur from restoration', ' in other words, the effect on the operations of the employing office of reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n(c)A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic viability of the employing office, that would constitute substantial and grievous economic injury. A lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and costs that the employing office would experience in the normal course would certainly not constitute substantial and grievous economic injury. (d)FMLA’s substantial and grievous economic injury standard is different from and more stringent than the undue hardship test under the ADA, as made applicable by the CAA. See also 825.702.\n825.219Rights of a key employee\n(a)An employing office that believes that reinstatement may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the same time, the employing office must also fully inform the employee of the potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the employing office should determine that substantial and grievous economic injury to the employing office’s operations will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If such notice cannot be given immediately because of the need to determine whether the employee is a key employee, it shall be given as soon as practicable after being notified of a need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier). It is expected that in most circumstances there will be no desire that an employee be denied restoration after FMLA leave and, therefore, there would be no need to provide such notice. However, an employing office who fails to provide such timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration even if substantial and grievous economic injury will result from reinstatement. (b)As soon as an employing office makes a good faith determination, based on the facts available, that substantial and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing office shall notify the employee in writing of its determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice must explain the basis for the employing office’s finding that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n(c)If an employee on leave does not return to work in response to the employing office’s notification of intent to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key employee’s rights under FMLA continue unless and until the employee either gives notice that he or she no longer wishes to return to work, or the employing office actually denies reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period. (d)After notice to an employee has been given that substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave period even if the employee did not return to work in response to the employing office’s notice. The employing office must then again determine whether there will be substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n825.220Protection for employees who request leave or otherwise assert FMLA rights\n(a)The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits interference with an employee’s rights under the law, and with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee’s rights. More specifically, the law contains the following employee protections: (1)An employing office is prohibited from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA.\n(2)An employing office is prohibited from discharging or in any other way discriminating against any covered employee (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. (3)All employing offices are prohibited from discharging or in any other way discriminating against any covered employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that covered employee has—\n(A)Filed any claim, or has instituted (or caused to be instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA', '  (B)Given, or is about to give, any information in connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA', ' \n(C)Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. (b)Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. An employing office may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. See 825.400(b). Interfering with the exercise of an employee’s rights would include, for example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but discouraging an employee from using such leave. It would also include manipulation by a covered employing office to avoid responsibilities under FMLA, for example:\n(1)Reserved (2)Changing the essential functions of the job in order to preclude the taking of leave', ' or\n(3)Reducing hours available to work in order to avoid employee eligibility. (c)The FMLA’s prohibition against interference prohibits an employing office from discriminating or retaliating against an employee or prospective employee for having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, employing offices cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions', ' nor can FMLA leave be counted under no fault attendance policies. See 825.215.\n(d)Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For example, employees (or their collective bargaining representatives) cannot trade off the right to take FMLA leave against some other benefit offered by the employing office. Except for settlement agreements covered by 1414 and/or 1415 of the Congressional Accountability Act, this does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by employees based on past employing office conduct without the approval of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights or a court. Nor does it prevent an employee’s voluntary and uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a light duty assignment while recovering from a serious health condition. See 825.702(d). An employee’s acceptance of such light duty assignment does not constitute a waiver of the employee’s prospective rights, including the right to be restored to the same position the employee held at the time the employee’s FMLA leave commenced or to an equivalent position. The employee’s right to restoration, however, ceases at the end of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year. (e)Covered employees, and not merely eligible employees, are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., filing a complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or regulations.\nCEmployee and Employing Office Rights and Obligations Under The FMLA, As Made Applicable by the CAA\n825.300Employing office notice requirements\n(a)\n(1)If an employing office has any eligible employees and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, information concerning both entitlements and employee obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, must be included in the handbook or other document. For example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook to all employees that describes the employing office’s policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA rights and responsibilities and the employing office’s policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. Informational publications describing the provisions of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, are available from the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights and may be incorporated in such employing office handbooks or written policies. (2)If such an employing office does not have written policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee’s rights and obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time notice is given pursuant to paragraph (c), and in accordance with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact Sheet available from the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights to provide such guidance.\n(b)Eligibility notice. (1)When an employee requests FMLA leave, or when the employing office acquires knowledge that an employee’s leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the employing office must notify the employee of the employee’s eligibility to take FMLA leave within five business days, absent extenuating circumstances. See 825.110 for definition of an eligible employee. Employee eligibility is determined (and notice must be provided) at the commencement of the first instance of leave for each FMLA-qualifying reason in the applicable 12–month period. See 825.127(c) and 825.200(b). All FMLA absences for the same qualifying reason are considered a single leave and employee eligibility as to that reason for leave does not change during the applicable 12-month period. \n(2)The eligibility notice must state whether the employee is eligible for FMLA leave as defined in 825.110. If the employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, the notice must state at least one reason why the employee is not eligible, including as applicable the number of months the employee has been employed by the employing office and the hours of service with the employing office during the 12-month period. Notification of eligibility may be oral or in writing', ' employing offices may use Form C to provide such notification to employees. (3)If, at the time an employee provides notice of a subsequent need for FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period due to a different FMLA-qualifying reason, and the employee’s eligibility status has not changed, no additional eligibility notice is required. If, however, the employee’s eligibility status has changed (e.g., if the employee has not met the hours of service requirement in the 12 months preceding the commencement of leave for the subsequent qualifying reason), the employing office must notify the employee of the change in eligibility status within five business days, absent extenuating circumstances.\n(c)Rights and responsibilities notice. (1)Employing offices shall provide written notice detailing the specific expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations. This notice shall be provided to the employee each time the eligibility notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. If leave has already begun, the notice should be mailed to the employee’s address of record. Such specific notice must include, as appropriate:\n(A)That the leave may be designated and counted against the employee’s annual FMLA leave entitlement if qualifying (See 825.300(c) and 825.301) and the applicable 12-month period for FMLA entitlement (See 825.127(c), 825.200(b), (f), and (g))', ' (B)Any requirements for the employee to furnish certification of a serious health condition, serious injury or illness, or qualifying exigency arising out of covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and the consequences of failing to do so (See 825.305, 825.309, 825.310, 825.313)', '\n(C)If applicable, the employee’s right to substitute paid parental leave for unpaid FMLA leave for a birth or placement (See 825.208) and the employee’s right to substitute paid leave generally, whether the employing office will require the substitution of paid leave, the conditions related to any substitution, and the employee’s entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if the employee does not meet the conditions for paid leave (See 825.207)', ' (D)Any requirement for the employee to make any premium payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for making such payments (See 825.210), and the possible consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may lapse)', '\n(E)The employee’s status as a key employee and the potential consequence that restoration may be denied following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for such denial (See 825.218)', ' (F)The employee’s right to maintenance of benefits during the FMLA leave and restoration to the same or an equivalent job upon return from FMLA leave (See 825.214 and 825.604)', ' and\n(G)The employee’s potential liability for payment of health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during the employee’s unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to return to work after taking FMLA leave (See 825.213, 825.208(k)). (2)The notice of rights and responsibilities may include other information—e.g., whether the employing office will require periodic reports of the employee’s status and intent to return to work—but is not required to do so.\n(3)The notice of rights and responsibilities may be accompanied by any required certification form. (4)If the specific information provided by the notice of rights and responsibilities changes, the employing office shall, within five business days of receipt of the employee’s first notice of need for leave subsequent to any change, provide written notice referencing the prior notice and setting forth any of the information in the notice of rights and responsibilities that has changed. For example, if the initial leave period was paid leave and the subsequent leave period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need to give notice of the arrangements for making premium payments.\n(5)Employing offices are also expected to responsively answer questions from employees concerning their rights and responsibilities under the FMLA, as made applicable under the CAA. (6)A prototype notice of rights and responsibilities may be obtained in Form C, or from the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. Employing offices may adapt the prototype notice as appropriate to meet these notice requirements. The notice of rights and responsibilities may be distributed electronically so long as it otherwise meets the requirements of this section.\n(d)Designation notice. (1)The employing office is responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to the employee as provided in this section. When the employing office has enough information to determine whether the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason (e.g., after receiving a certification), the employing office must notify the employee whether the leave will be designated and will be counted as FMLA leave within five business days absent extenuating circumstances. Only one notice of designation is required for each FMLA-qualifying reason per applicable 12-month period, regardless of whether the leave taken due to the qualifying reason will be a continuous block of leave or intermittent or reduced schedule leave. If the employing office determines that the leave will not be designated as FMLA-qualifying (e.g., if the leave is not for a reason covered by FMLA or the FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted), the employing office must notify the employee of that determination. Subject to 825.208, if the employing office requires paid leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, or that paid leave taken under an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, the employing office must inform the employee of this designation at the time of designating the FMLA leave.\n(2)If the employing office has sufficient information to designate the leave as FMLA leave immediately after receiving notice of the employee’s need for leave, the employing office may provide the employee with the designation notice at that time. (3)If the employing office will require the employee to present a fitness-for-duty certification to be restored to employment, the employing office must provide notice of such requirement with the designation notice. If the employing office will require that the fitness-for-duty certification address the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the employee’s position, the employing office must so indicate in the designation notice, and must include a list of the essential functions of the employee’s position. See 825.312. If the employing office’s handbook or other written documents (if any) describing the employing office’s leave policies clearly provide that a fitness-for- duty certification will be required in specific circumstances (e.g., by stating that fitness- for-duty certification will be required in all cases of back injuries for employees in a certain occupation), the employing office is not required to provide written notice of the requirement with the designation notice, but must provide oral notice no later than with the designation notice.\n(4)The designation notice must be in writing. A prototype designation notice is contained in Form D which may be obtained from the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. If the leave is not designated as FMLA leave because it does not meet the requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, the notice to the employee that the leave is not designated as FMLA leave may be in the form of a simple written statement. The designation notice may be distributed electronically so long as it otherwise meets the requirements of this section and the employing office can demonstrate that the employee (who may already be on leave and who may not have access to employing office-provided computers) has access to the information electronically. (5)If the information provided by the employing office to the employee in the designation notice changes (e.g., the employee exhausts the FMLA leave entitlement), the employing office shall provide, within five business days of receipt of the employee’s first notice of need for leave subsequent to any change, written notice of the change.\n(6)The employing office must notify the employee of the amount of leave counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement and, if applicable, the employee’s paid parental leave entitlement. If the amount of leave needed is known at the time the employing office designates the leave as FMLA-qualifying, the employing office must notify the employee of the number of hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement in the designation notice. If it is not possible to provide the hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement (such as in the case of unforeseeable intermittent leave), then the employing office must provide notice of the amount of leave counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement and, if applicable, paid parental leave entitlement, upon the request by the employee, but no more often than once in a 30–day period and only if leave was taken in that period. The notice of the amount of leave counted against the employee’s FMLA entitlement and, if applicable, paid parental leave entitlement may be oral or in writing. If such notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in writing no later than the following payday (unless the payday is less than one week after the oral notice, in which case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). Such written notice may be in any form, including a notation on the employee’s pay stub. (e)Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to follow the notice requirements set forth in this section may constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the exercise of an employee’s FMLA rights. An employing office may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. See 825.400(b).\n825.301Designation of FMLA leave\n(a)Employing office responsibilities. The employing office’s decision to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying must be based only on information received from the employee or the employee’s spokesperson (e.g., if the employee is incapacitated, the employee’s spouse, adult child, parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice to the employing office of the need to take FMLA leave). In any circumstance where the employing office does not have sufficient information about the reason for an employee’s use of leave, the employing office should inquire further of the employee or the spokesperson to ascertain whether leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Once the employing office has acquired knowledge that the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employing office must notify the employee as provided in 825.300(d).  (b)Employee responsibilities. An employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave does not need to expressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to provide notice, though the employee would need to state a qualifying reason for the needed leave and otherwise satisfy the notice requirements set forth in 825.302 or 825.303 depending on whether the need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. An employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the employing office to determine whether the leave qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a request to use leave, especially when the need for the leave was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide sufficient information for the employing office to designate the leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid leave may in some cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their plans for using their accrued leave. However, if an employee requesting to use paid leave for a FMLA-qualifying reason does not explain the reason for the leave and the employing office denies the employee’s request, the employee will need to provide sufficient information to establish a FMLA-qualifying reason for the needed leave so that the employing office is aware that the leave may not be denied and may designate that the paid leave be appropriately counted against (substituted for) the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Similarly, an employee using accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid leave for a FMLA-qualifying reason will need to state the reason. If this is due to an event which occurred during the period of paid leave, the employing office may count the leave used after the FMLA-qualifying reason against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. \n(c)Disputes. If there is a dispute between an employing office and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the decision must be documented. (d)Retroactive designation. Subject to 825.208, if an employing office does not designate leave as required by 825.300, the employing office may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate notice to the employee as required by 825.300 provided that the employing office’s failure to timely designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the employee. In all cases where leave would qualify for FMLA protections, an employing office and an employee can mutually agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.\n(e)Remedies. If an employing office’s failure to timely designate leave in accordance with 825.300 causes the employee to suffer harm, it may constitute an interference with, restraint of, or denial of the exercise of an employee’s FMLA rights. An employing office may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. See 825.400(b). For example, if an employing office that was put on notice that an employee needed FMLA leave failed to designate the leave properly, but the employee’s own serious health condition prevented him or her from returning to work during that time period regardless of the designation, an employee may not be able to show that the employee suffered harm as a result of the employing office’s actions. However, if an employee took leave to provide care for a son or daughter with a serious health condition believing it would not count toward his or her FMLA entitlement, and the employee planned to later use that FMLA leave to provide care for a spouse who would need assistance when recovering from surgery planned for a later date, the employee may be able to show that harm has occurred as a result of the employing office’s failure to designate properly. The employee might establish this by showing that he or she would have arranged for an alternative caregiver for the seriously-ill son or daughter if the leave had been designated timely. 825.302Employee notice requirements for foreseeable FMLA leave (a)Timing of notice. An employee must provide the employing office at least 30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or of a family member, or the planned medical treatment for a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember. If 30 days’ notice is not practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as practicable. For example, an employee’s health condition may require leave to commence earlier than anticipated before the birth of a child. Similarly, little opportunity for notice may be given before placement for adoption. For foreseeable leave due to a qualifying exigency, notice must be provided as soon as practicable, regardless of how far in advance such leave is foreseeable. Whether FMLA leave is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, but the employee shall advise the employing office as soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are extended, or were initially unknown. In those cases where the employee is required to provide at least 30 days’ notice of foreseeable leave and does not do so, the employee shall explain the reasons why such notice was not practicable upon a request from the employing office for such information.\n(b)As soon as practicable means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. When an employee becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, it should be practicable for the employee to provide notice of the need for leave either the same day or the next business day. In all cases, however, the determination of when an employee could practicably provide notice must take into account the individual facts and circumstances. (c)Content of notice. An employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employing office aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Depending on the situation, such information may include that a condition renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the job', ' that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized overnight', ' whether the employee or the employee’s family member is under the continuing care of a health care provider', ' if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that a military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty), and that the requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in 825.126(b)', ' if the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders the family member unable to perform daily activities, or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness', ' and the anticipated duration of the absence, if known. When an employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA. When an employee seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying reason, for which the employing office has previously provided FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically reference the qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave. In all cases, the employing office should inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the case of medical conditions, the employing office may find it necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is because of a serious health condition and may request medical certification to support the need for such leave. See 825.305. An employing office may also request certification to support the need for leave for a qualifying exigency or for military caregiver leave. See 825.309, 825.310. When an employee has been previously certified for leave due to more than one FMLA-qualifying reason, the employing office may need to inquire further to determine for which qualifying reason the leave is needed. An employee has an obligation to respond to an employing office’s questions designed to determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to respond to reasonable employing office inquiries regarding the leave request may result in denial of FMLA protection if the employing office is unable to determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying. \n(d)Complying with the employing office policy. An employing office may require an employee to comply with the employing office’s usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances. For example, an employing office may require that written notice set forth the reasons for the requested leave, the anticipated duration of the leave, and the anticipated start of the leave. An employee also may be required by an employing office’s policy to contact a specific individual. Unusual circumstances would include situations such as when an employee is unable to comply with the employing office’s policy that requests for leave should be made by contacting a specific number because on the day the employee needs to provide notice of his or her need for FMLA leave there is no one to answer the call-in number and the voice mail box is full. Where an employee does not comply with the employing office’s usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or denied. However, FMLA-protected leave may not be delayed or denied where the employing office’s policy requires notice to be given sooner than set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and the employee provides timely notice as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.  (e)Scheduling planned medical treatment. When planning medical treatment, the employee must consult with the employing office and make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employing office’s operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to consult with their employing offices prior to the scheduling of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which best suits the needs of both the employing office and the employee. For example, if an employee who provides notice of the need to take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to make a reasonable effort to arrange the schedule of treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office’s operations, the employing office may initiate discussions with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care provider. See 825.203 and 825.205.\n(f)Intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition or a serious injury or illness. An employee shall advise the employing office, upon request, of the reasons why the intermittent/reduced leave schedule is necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable. The employee and employing office shall attempt to work out a schedule for such leave that meets the employee’s needs without unduly disrupting the employing office’s operations, subject to the approval of the health care provider. (g)An employing office may waive employees’ FMLA notice requirements. See 825.304(e).\n825.303Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA leave\n(a)Timing of notice. When the approximate timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide notice to the employing office as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. It generally should be practicable for the employee to provide notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time prescribed by the employing office’s usual and customary notice requirements applicable to such leave. See 825.303(c). Notice may be given by the employee’s spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult family member, or other responsible party) if the employee is unable to do so personally. For example, if an employee’s child has a severe asthma attack and the employee takes the child to the emergency room, the employee would not be required to leave his or her child in order to report the absence while the child is receiving emergency treatment. However, if the child’s asthma attack required only the use of an inhaler at home followed by a period of rest, the employee would be expected to call the employing office promptly after ensuring the child has used the inhaler. (b)Content of notice. An employee shall provide sufficient information for an employing office to reasonably determine whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request. Depending on the situation, such information may include that a condition renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the job', ' that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized overnight', ' whether the employee or the employee’s family member is under the continuing care of a health care provider', ' if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that a military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty), that the requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in 825.126(b), and the anticipated duration of the absence', ' or if the leave is for a family member that the condition renders the family member unable to perform daily activities or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness', ' and the anticipated duration of the absence, if known. When an employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA. When an employee seeks leave due to a qualifying reason, for which the employing office has previously provided the employee FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically reference either the qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave. Calling in sick without providing more information will not be considered sufficient notice to trigger an employing office’s obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. The employing office will be expected to obtain any additional required information through informal means. An employee has an obligation to respond to an employing office’s questions designed to determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to respond to reasonable employing office inquiries office regarding the leave request may result in denial of FMLA protection if the employing office is unable to determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.\n(c)Complying with employing office policy. When the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with the employing office’s usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual circumstances. For example, an employing office may require employees to call a designated number or a specific individual to request leave. However, if an employee requires emergency medical treatment, he or she would not be required to follow the call-in procedure until his or her condition is stabilized and he or she has access to, and is able to use, a phone. Similarly, in the case of an emergency requiring leave because of a FMLA-qualifying reason, written advance notice pursuant to an employing office’s internal rules and procedures may not be required when FMLA leave is involved. If an employee does not comply with the employing office’s usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or denied. 825.304Employee failure to provide notice (a)Proper notice required. In all cases, in order for the onset of an employee’s FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack of required notice, it must be clear that the employee had actual notice of the FMLA notice requirements. This condition would be satisfied by the employing office’s proper posting, at the worksite where the employee is employed, of the information regarding the FMLA provided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1381(h)(2)) by the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights to the employing office in a manner suitable for posting.\n(b)Foreseeable leave—30 days. When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance and an employee fails to give timely advance notice with no reasonable excuse, the employing office may delay FMLA coverage until 30 days after the date the employee provides notice. The need for leave and the approximate date leave would be taken must have been clearly foreseeable to the employee 30 days in advance of the leave. For example, knowledge that an employee would receive a telephone call about the availability of a child for adoption at some unknown point in the future would not be sufficient to establish the leave was clearly foreseeable 30 days in advance. (c)Foreseeable leave—less than 30 days. When the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable fewer than 30 days in advance and an employee fails to give notice as soon as practicable under the particular facts and circumstances, the extent to which an employing office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends on the facts of the particular case. For example, if an employee reasonably should have given the employing office two weeks’ notice but instead only provided one week’s notice, then the employing office may delay FMLA-protected leave for one week (thus, if the employing office elects to delay FMLA coverage and the employee nonetheless takes leave one week after providing the notice (i.e., a week before the two week notice period has been met) the leave will not be FMLA-protected).\n(d)Unforeseeable leave. When the need for FMLA leave is unforeseeable and an employee fails to give notice in accordance with 825.303, the extent to which an employing office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends on the facts of the particular case. For example, if it would have been practicable for an employee to have given the employing office notice of the need for leave very soon after the need arises consistent with the employing office’s policy, but instead the employee provided notice two days after the leave began, then the employing office may delay FMLA coverage of the leave by two days. (e)Waiver of notice. An employing office may waive employees’ FMLA notice obligations or the employing office’s own internal rules on leave notice requirements. If an employing office does not waive the employee’s obligations under its internal leave rules, the employing office may take appropriate action under its internal rules and procedures for failure to follow its usual and customary notification rules, absent unusual circumstances, as long as the actions are taken in a manner that does not discriminate against employees taking FMLA leave and the rules are not inconsistent with 825.303(a).\n825.305Certification, general rule\n(a)General. An employing office may require that an employee’s leave to care for the employee’s covered family member with a serious health condition, or due to the employee’s own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of the employee’s position, be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee’s family member. An employing office may also require that an employee’s leave because of a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness be supported by a certification, as described in 825.309 and 825.310, respectively. An employing office must give notice of a requirement for certification each time a certification is required', ' such notice must be written notice whenever required by 825.300(c). An employing office’s oral request to an employee to furnish any subsequent certification is sufficient. (b)Timing. In most cases, the employing office should request that an employee furnish certification at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within five business days thereafter, or, in the case of unforeseen leave, within five business days after the leave commences. The employing office may request certification at some later date if the employing office later has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. The employee must provide the requested certification to the employing office within 15 calendar days after the employing office’s request, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts or the employing office provides more than 15 calendar days to return the requested certification.\n(c)Complete and sufficient certification. The employee must provide a complete and sufficient certification to the employing office if required by the employing office in accordance with 825.306, 825.309, and 825.310. The employing office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office finds a certification incomplete or insufficient, and shall state in writing what additional information is necessary to make the certification complete and sufficient. A certification is considered incomplete if the employing office receives a certification, but one or more of the applicable entries have not been completed. A certification is considered insufficient if the employing office receives a complete certification, but the information provided is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive. The employing office must provide the employee with seven calendar days (unless not practicable under the particular circumstances despite the employee’s diligent good faith efforts) to cure any such deficiency. If the deficiencies specified by the employing office are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in accordance with 825.313. A certification that is not returned to the employing office is not considered incomplete or insufficient, but constitutes a failure to provide certification. (d)Consequences. At the time the employing office requests certification, the employing office must also advise an employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee’s failure to provide adequate certification. If the employee fails to provide the employing office with a complete and sufficient certification, despite the opportunity to cure the certification as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or fails to provide any certification, the employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in accordance with 825.313. It is the employee’s responsibility either to furnish a complete and sufficient certification or to furnish the health care provider providing the certification with any necessary authorization from the employee or the employee’s family member in order for the health care provider to release a complete and sufficient certification to the employing office to support the employee’s FMLA request. This provision will apply in any case where an employing office requests a certification permitted by these regulations, whether it is the initial certification, a recertification, a second or third opinion, or a fitness-for-duty certificate, including any clarifications necessary to determine if such certifications are authentic and sufficient. See 825.306, 825.307, 825.308, and 825.312. (e) Annual medical certification. Where the employee’s need for leave due to the employee’s own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of the employee’s covered family member, lasts beyond a single leave year (as defined in 825.200), the employing office may require the employee to provide a new medical certification in each subsequent leave year. Such new medical certifications are subject to the provisions for authentication and clarification set forth in 825.307, including second and third opinions.\n825.306Content of medical certification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member\n(a)Required information. When leave is taken because of an employee’s own serious health condition, or the serious health condition of a family member, an employing office may require an employee to obtain a medical certification from a health care provider that sets forth the following information: (1)The name, address, telephone number, and fax number of the health care provider and type of medical practice/specialization', '\n(2)The approximate date on which the serious health condition commenced, and its probable duration', ' (4)If the employee is the patient, information sufficient to establish that the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the employee’s job as well as the nature of any other work restrictions, and the likely duration of such inability (See 825.123(b))', '\n(5)If the patient is a covered family member with a serious health condition, information sufficient to establish that the family member is in need of care, as described in 825.124, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the leave required to care for the family member', ' (6)If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment of the employee’s or a covered family member’s serious health condition, information sufficient to establish the medical necessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule leave and an estimate of the dates and duration of such treatments and any periods of recovery', '\n(7)If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for the employee’s serious health condition, including pregnancy, that may result in unforeseeable episodes of incapacity, information sufficient to establish the medical necessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule leave and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the episodes of incapacity', ' and (8)If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a covered family member with a serious health condition, a statement that such leave is medically necessary to care for the family member, as described in 825.124 and 825.203(b), which can include assisting in the family member’s recovery, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the required leave.\n(b)The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights has developed two optional forms (Form A and Form B) for use in obtaining medical certification, including second and third opinions, from health care providers that meets FMLA’s certification requirements, as made applicable by the CAA. (See Forms A and B.) Optional Form A is for use when the employee’s need for leave is due to the employee’s own serious health condition. Optional Form B is for use when the employee needs leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition. These optional forms reflect certification requirements so as to permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate medical information. Forms A and B are modeled closely on Form WH–380E and Form WH–380F, as revised, which were developed by the Department of Labor (See 29 C.F.R. Part 825). The employing office may use the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights’s forms, or Form WH–380E and Form WH–380F, as revised, or another form containing the same basic information', ' however, no information may be required beyond that specified in 825.306, 825.307, and 825.308. In all instances the information on the form must relate only to the serious health condition for which the current need for leave exists. (c)If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently with a workers’ compensation absence, and the provisions of the workers’ compensation statute permit the employing office or the employing office’s representative to request additional information from the employee’s workers’ compensation health care provider, the FMLA does not prevent the employing office from following the applicable workers’ compensation provisions and information received under those provisions may be considered in determining the employee’s entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. Similarly, an employing office may request additional information in accordance with a paid leave policy or disability plan that requires greater information to qualify for payments or benefits, provided that the employing office informs the employee that the additional information only needs to be provided in connection with receipt of such payments or benefits. Any information received pursuant to such policy or plan may be considered in determining the employee’s entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. If the employee fails to provide the information required for receipt of such payments or benefits, such failure will not affect the employee’s entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave. See 825.207(a).\n(d)If an employee’s serious health condition may also be a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by the CAA, the FMLA does not prevent the employing office from following the procedures for requesting medical information under the ADA. Any information received pursuant to these procedures may be considered in determining the employee’s entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. (e)While an employee may choose to comply with the certification requirement by providing the employing office with an authorization, release, or waiver allowing the employing office to communicate directly with the health care provider of the employee or his or her covered family member, the employee may not be required to provide such an authorization, release, or waiver. In all instances in which certification is requested, it is the employee’s responsibility to provide the employing office with complete and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).\n825.307Authentication and clarification of medical certification for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member', ' second and third opinions\n(a)Clarification and authentication.  (1)If an employee submits a complete and sufficient certification signed by the health care provider, the employing office may not request additional information from the health care provider. However, the employing office may contact the health care provider for purposes of clarification and authentication of the medical certification (whether initial certification or recertification) after the employing office has given the employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies as set forth in 825.305(c). To make such contact, the employing office must use a health care provider, a human resources professional, a leave administrator, or a management official. An employee’s direct supervisor may not contact the employee’s health care provider, unless the direct supervisor is also the only individual in the employing office designated to process FMLA requests and the direct supervisor receives specific authorization from the employee to contact the employee’s health care provider. For purposes of these regulations, authentication means providing the health care provider with a copy of the certification and requesting verification that the information contained on the certification form was completed and/ or authorized by the health care provider who signed the document', ' no additional medical information may be requested.\n(2)Clarification means contacting the health care provider to understand the handwriting on the medical certification or to understand the meaning of a response. Employing offices may not ask health care providers for additional information beyond that required by the certification form. The requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, (See 45 C.F.R. parts 160 and 164), which governs the privacy of individually-identifiable health information created or held by HIPAA-covered entities, must be satisfied when individually-identifiable health information of an employee is shared with an employing office by a HIPAA-covered health care provider. If an employee chooses not to provide the employing office with authorization allowing the employing office to clarify the certification with the health care provider, and does not otherwise clarify the certification, the employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave if the certification is unclear. See 825.305(d). It is the employee’s responsibility to provide the employing office with a complete and sufficient certification and to clarify the certification if necessary. (b)Second Opinion.\n(1)An employing office that has reason to doubt the validity of a medical certification may require the employee to obtain a second opinion at the employing office’s expense. Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, including maintenance of group health benefits. If the certifications do not ultimately establish the employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave, the leave shall not be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or unpaid leave under the employing office’s established leave policies. In addition, the consequences set forth in 825.305(d) will apply if the employee or the employee’s family member fails to authorize his or her health care provider to release all relevant medical information pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if requested by the health care provider designated to provide a second opinion in order to render a sufficient and complete second opinion. (2)The employing office is permitted to designate the health care provider to furnish the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may not be employed on a regular basis by the employing office. The employing office may not regularly contract with or otherwise regularly utilize the services of the health care provider furnishing the second opinion unless the employing office is located in an area where access to health care is extremely limited (e.g., a rural area where no more than one or two doctors practice in the relevant specialty in the vicinity).\n(c)Third opinion. If the opinions of the employee’s and the employing office’s designated health care providers differ, the employing office may require the employee to obtain certification from a third health care provider, again at the employing office’s expense. This third opinion shall be final and binding. The third health care provider must be designated or approved jointly by the employing office and the employee. The employing office and the employee must each act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to select for the third opinion provider. If the employing office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the employing office will be bound by the first certification. If the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the employee will be bound by the second certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing to act in good faith. On the other hand, an employing office that refuses to agree to any doctor on a list of specialists in the appropriate field provided by the employee and whom the employee has not previously consulted may be failing to act in good faith. In addition, the consequences set forth in 825.305(d) will apply if the employee or the employee’s family member fails to authorize his or her health care provider to release all relevant medical information pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if requested by the health care provider designated to provide a third opinion in order to render a sufficient and complete third opinion. (d)Copies of opinions. The employing office is required to provide the employee with a copy of the second and third medical opinions, where applicable, upon request by the employee. Requested copies are to be provided within five business days unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.\n(e)Travel expenses. If the employing office requires the employee to obtain either a second or third opinion the employing office must reimburse an employee or family member for any reasonable out of pocket travel expenses incurred to obtain the second and third medical opinions. The employing office may not require the employee or family member to travel outside normal commuting distance for purposes of obtaining the second or third medical opinions except in very unusual circumstances. (f)Medical certification abroad. In circumstances in which the employee or a family member is visiting in another country, or a family member resides in another country, and a serious health condition develops, the employing office shall accept a medical certification as well as second and third opinions from a health care provider who practices in that country. Where a certification by a foreign health care provider is in a language other than English, the employee must provide the employing office with a written translation of the certification upon request.\n825.308Recertifications for leave taken because of an employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member\n(a)30-day rule. An employing office may request recertification no more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an absence by the employee, unless paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section apply. (b)More than 30 days. If the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more than 30 days, an employing office must wait until that minimum duration expires before requesting a recertification, unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. For example, if the medical certification states that an employee will be unable to work, whether continuously or on an intermittent basis, for 40 days, the employing office must wait 40 days before requesting a recertification. In all cases, an employing office may request a recertification of a medical condition every six months in connection with an absence by the employee. Accordingly, even if the medical certification indicates that the employee will need intermittent or reduced schedule leave for a period in excess of six months (e.g., for a lifetime condition), the employing office would be permitted to request recertification every six months in connection with an absence.\n(c)Less than 30 days. An employing office may request recertification in less than 30 days if: (1)The employee requests an extension of leave', '\n(2)Circumstances described by the previous certification have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency of the absence, the nature or severity of the illness, complications). For example, if a medical certification stated that an employee would need leave for one to two days when the employee suffered a migraine headache and the employee’s absences for his or her last two migraines lasted four days each, then the increased duration of absence might constitute a significant change in circumstances allowing the employing office to request a recertification in less than 30 days. Likewise, if an employee had a pattern of using unscheduled FMLA leave for migraines in conjunction with his or her scheduled days off, then the timing of the absences also might constitute a significant change in circumstances sufficient for an employing office to request a recertification more frequently than every 30 days', ' or (3)The employing office receives information that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated reason for the absence or the continuing validity of the certification. For example, if an employee is on FMLA leave for four weeks due to the employee’s knee surgery, including recuperation, and the employee plays in company softball league games during the employee’s third week of FMLA leave, such information might be sufficient to cast doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification allowing the employing office to request a recertification in less than 30 days.\n(d)Timing. The employee must provide the requested recertification to the employing office within the time frame requested by the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the employing office’s request), unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. (e)Content. The employing office may ask for the same information when obtaining recertification as that permitted for the original certification as set forth in 825.306. The employee has the same obligations to participate and cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient certification or adequate authorization to the health care provider) in the recertification process as in the initial certification process. See 825.305(d). As part of the information allowed to be obtained on recertification for leave taken because of a serious health condition, the employing office may provide the health care provider with a record of the employee’s absence pattern and ask the health care provider if the serious health condition and need for leave is consistent with such a pattern.\n(f)Any recertification requested by the employing office shall be at the employee’s expense unless the employing office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on recertification may be required. 825.309Certification for leave taken because of a qualifying exigency (a)Active Duty Orders. The first time an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or notification of an impending call or order to covered active duty) of a military member (See 825.126(a)), an employing office may require the employee to provide a copy of the military member’s active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and the dates of the military member’s covered active duty service. This information need only be provided to the employing office once. A copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military may be required by the employing office if the need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or notification of an impending call or order to covered active duty) of the same or a different military member', '\n(b)Required information. An employing office may require that leave for any qualifying exigency specified in 825.126 be supported by a certification from the employee that sets forth the following information: (1)A statement or description, signed by the employee, of appropriate facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which FMLA leave is requested. The facts must be sufficient to support the need for leave. Such facts should include information on the type of qualifying exigency for which leave is requested and any available written documentation which supports the request for leave', ' such documentation, for example, may include a copy of a meeting announcement for informational briefings sponsored by the military, a document confirming an appointment with a counselor or school official, or a copy of a bill for services for the handling of legal or financial affairs', '\n(2)The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency commenced or will commence', ' (3)If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency for a single, continuous period of time, the beginning and end dates for such absence', '\n(4)If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, an estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying exigency', ' (5)If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party, appropriate contact information for the individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting (such as the name, title, organization, address, telephone number, fax number, and email address) and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting', ' and\n(6)If the qualifying exigency involves Rest and Recuperation leave, a copy of the military member’s Rest and Recuperation orders, or other documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military member has been granted Rest and Recuperation leave, and the dates of the military member’s Rest and Recuperation leave. (c)The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights has developed an optional form (Form E) for employees’ use in obtaining a certification that meets FMLA’s certification requirements. This optional form reflects certification requirements so as to permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying exigency. Form E, or Form WH–384 (developed by the Department of Labor), or another form containing the same basic information, may be used by the employing office', ' however, no information may be required beyond that specified in this section.\n(d)Verification. If an employee submits a complete and sufficient certification to support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying exigency, the employing office may not request additional information from the employee. However, if the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party, the employing office may contact the individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of verifying a meeting or appointment schedule and the nature of the meeting between the employee and the specified individual or entity. The employee’s permission is not required in order to verify meetings or appointments with third parties, but no additional information may be requested by the employing office. An employing office also may contact an appropriate unit of the Department of Defense to request verification that a military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty)', ' no additional information may be requested and the employee’s permission is not required. 825.310Certification for leave taken to care for a covered servicemember (military caregiver leave) (a)Required information from health care provider. When leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, an employing office may require an employee to obtain a certification completed by an authorized health care provider of the covered servicemember. For purposes of leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, any one of the following health care providers may complete such a certification: \n(1)A United States Department of Defense (DOD) health care provider', ' (2)A United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care provider', '\n(3)A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care provider', ' (4)A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health care provider', ' or\n(5)Any health care provider as defined in 825.125. (b)If the authorized health care provider is unable to make certain military-related determinations outlined below, the authorized health care provider may rely on determinations from an authorized DOD representative (such as a DOD recovery care coordinator) or an authorized VA representative. An employing office may request that the health care provider provide the following information:\n(1)The name, address, and appropriate contact information (telephone number, fax number, and/or email address) of the health care provider, the type of medical practice, the medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is one of the following: (A)A DOD health care provider', ' \n(B)A VA health care provider', ' (C)A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care provider', '\n(D)A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health care provider', ' or (E)A health care provider as defined in 825.125. \n(2)Whether the covered servicemember’s injury or illness was incurred in the line of duty on active duty or, if not, whether the covered servicemember’s injury or illness existed before the beginning of the servicemember’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty', ' (3)The approximate date on which the serious injury or illness commenced, or was aggravated, and its probable duration', '\n(4)A statement or description of appropriate medical facts regarding the covered servicemember’s health condition for which FMLA leave is requested. The medical facts must be sufficient to support the need for leave. (A)In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, such medical facts must include information on whether the injury or illness may render the covered servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating and whether the member is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy', '\n(B)In the case of a covered veteran, such medical facts must include: (i)Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness that is the continuation of an injury or illness that was incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating', ' or\n(ii)Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness that is a physical or mental condition for which the covered veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or greater, and that such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, on the condition precipitating the need for military caregiver leave', ' or (iii)Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness that is a physical or mental condition that substantially impairs the covered veteran’s ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or disabilities related to military service, or would do so absent treatment', ' or \n(iv)Documentation of enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.  (5)Information sufficient to establish that the covered servicemember is in need of care, as described in 825.124, and whether the covered servicemember will need care for a single continuous period of time, including any time for treatment and recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning and ending dates for this period of time', '\n(6)If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic care and an estimate of the treatment schedule of such appointments', ' (7)If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis to care for a covered servicemember other than for planned medical treatment (e.g., episodic flare-ups of a medical condition), whether there is a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic care, which can include assisting in the covered servicemember’s recovery, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the periodic care.\n(c)Required information from employee and/ or covered servicemember. In addition to the information that may be requested under 825.310(b), an employing office may also request that such certification set forth the following information provided by an employee and/or covered servicemember: (1)The name and address of the employing office of the employee requesting leave to care for a covered servicemember, the name of the employee requesting such leave, and the name of the covered servicemember for whom the employee is requesting leave to care', '\n(2)The relationship of the employee to the covered servicemember for whom the employee is requesting leave to care', ' (3)Whether the covered servicemember is a current member of the Armed Forces, the National Guard or Reserves, and the covered servicemember’s military branch, rank, and current unit assignment', '\n(4)Whether the covered servicemember is assigned to a military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients (such as a medical hold or warrior transition unit), and the name of the medical treatment facility or unit', ' (5)Whether the covered servicemember is on the temporary disability retired list', '\n(6)Whether the covered servicemember is a veteran, the date of separation from military service, and whether the separation was other than dishonorable. The employing office may require the employee to provide documentation issued by the military which indicates that the covered servicemember is a veteran, the date of separation, and that the separation is other than dishonorable. Where an employing office requires such documentation, an employee may provide a copy of the veteran’s Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty issued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DD Form 214) or other proof of veteran status. See 825.127(c)(2). (7)A description of the care to be provided to the covered servicemember and an estimate of the leave needed to provide the care.\n(d)The Office of Congressional Workplace Rights has developed an optional form (Form F) for employees’ use in obtaining certification that meets FMLA’s certification requirements. This optional form reflects certification requirements so as to permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to support his or her request for leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Form F, or Form WH–385 (developed by the Department of Labor), or another form containing the same basic information, may be used by the employing office', ' however, no information may be required beyond that specified in this section. In all instances the information on the certification must relate only to the serious injury or illness for which the current need for leave exists. An employing office may seek authentication and/or clarification of the certification under 825.307. Second and third opinions under 825.307 are not permitted for leave to care for a covered servicemember when the certification has been completed by one of the types of healthcare providers identified in section 825.310(a)(1–4). However, second and third opinions under 825.307 are permitted when the certification has been completed by a health care provider as defined in 825.125 that is not one of the types identified in 825.310(a)(1)–(4). Additionally, recertifications under 825.308 are not permitted for leave to care for a covered servicemember. An employing office may require an employee to provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) of the FMLA. (e)An employing office requiring an employee to submit a certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember must accept as sufficient certification, in lieu of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights’s optional certification form (Form F) or an employing office’s own certification form, invitational travel orders (ITOs) or invitational travel authorizations (ITAs) issued to any family member to join an injured or ill servicemember at his or her bedside. An ITO or ITA is sufficient certification for the duration of time specified in the ITO or ITA. During that time period, an eligible employee may take leave to care for the covered servicemember in a continuous block of time or on an intermittent basis. An eligible employee who provides an ITO or ITA to support his or her request for leave may not be required to provide any additional or separate certification that leave taken on an intermittent basis during the period of time specified in the ITO or ITA is medically necessary. An ITO or ITA is sufficient certification for an employee entitled to take FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember regardless of whether the employee is named in the order or authorization.\n(1)If an employee will need leave to care for a covered servicemember beyond the expiration date specified in an ITO or ITA, an employing office may request that the employee have one of the authorized health care providers listed under 825.310(a) complete the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights optional certification form (Form F) or an employing office’s own form, as requisite certification for the remainder of the employee’s necessary leave period. (2)An employing office may seek authentication and clarification of the ITO or ITA under 825.307. An employing office may not utilize the second or third opinion process outlined in 825.307 or the recertification process under 825.308 during the period of time in which leave is supported by an ITO or ITA.\n(3)An employing office may require an employee to provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a copy of an ITO or ITA. (f)An employing office requiring an employee to submit a certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember must accept as sufficient certification of the servicemember’s serious injury or illness documentation indicating the servicemember’s enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Such documentation is sufficient certification of the servicemember’s serious injury or illness to support the employee’s request for military caregiver leave regardless of whether the employee is the named caregiver in the enrollment documentation.\n(1)An employing office may seek authentication and clarification of the documentation indicating the servicemember’s enrollment in the Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers under 825.307. An employing office may not utilize the second or third opinion process outlined in 825.307 or the recertification process under 825.308 when the servicemember’s serious injury or illness is shown by documentation of enrollment in this program. (2)An employing office may require an employee to provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a copy of such enrollment documentation. An employing office may also require an employee to provide documentation, such as a veteran’s Form DD–214, showing that the discharge was other than dishonorable and the date of the veteran’s discharge.\n(g)Where medical certification is requested by an employing office, an employee may not be held liable for administrative delays in the issuance of military documents, despite the employee’s diligent, good-faith efforts to obtain such documents. See 825.305(b). In all instances in which certification is requested, it is the employee’s responsibility to provide the employing office with complete and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).  825.311Intent to return to work (a)An employing office may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee’s status and intent to return to work. The employing office’s policy regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances related to the individual employee’s leave situation.\n(b)If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return to work, the employing office’s obligations under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease. However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a continuing desire to do so. (c)It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these situations, the employing office may require that the employee provide the employing office reasonable notice (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain information on such changed circumstances through requested status reports.\n825.312Fitness-for-duty certification\n(a)As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA leave was occasioned by the employee’s own serious health condition that made the employee unable to perform the employee’s job, an employing office may have a uniformly-applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious health condition) who take leave for such conditions to obtain and present certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee is able to resume work. The employee has the same obligations to participate and cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient certification or providing sufficient authorization to the health care provider to provide the information directly to the employing office) in the fitness-for-duty certification process as in the initial certification process. See 825.305(d). (b)An employing office may seek a fitness-for-duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee’s need for FMLA leave. The certification from the employee’s health care provider must certify that the employee is able to resume work. Additionally, an employing office may require that the certification specifically address the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the employee’s job. In order to require such a certification, an employing office must provide an employee with a list of the essential functions of the employee’s job no later than with the designation notice required by 825.300(d), and must indicate in the designation notice that the certification must address the employee’s ability to perform those essential functions. If the employing office satisfies these requirements, the employee’s health care provider must certify that the employee can perform the identified essential functions of his or her job. Following the procedures set forth in 825.307(a), the employing office may contact the employee’s health care provider for purposes of clarifying and authenticating the fitness-for-duty certification. Clarification may be requested only for the serious health condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing office may not delay the employee’s return to work while contact with the health care provider is being made. No second or third opinions on a fitness-for-duty certification may be required.\n(c)The cost of the certification shall be borne by the employee, and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification. (d)The designation notice required in 825.300(d) shall advise the employee if the employing office will require a fitness-for-duty certification to return to work and whether that fitness-for-duty certification must address the employee’s ability to perform the essential functions of the employee’s job.\n(e)An employing office may delay restoration to employment until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty certification unless the employing office has failed to provide the notice required in paragraph (d) of this section. If an employing office provides the notice required, an employee who does not provide a fitness-for-duty certification or request additional FMLA leave is no longer entitled to reinstatement under the FMLA. See 825.313(d). (f)An employing office is not entitled to a certification of fitness to return to duty for each absence taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. However, an employing office is entitled to a certification of fitness to return to duty for such absences up to once every 30 days if reasonable safety concerns exist regarding the employee’s ability to perform his or her duties, based on the serious health condition for which the employee took such leave. If an employing office chooses to require a fitness-for-duty certification under such circumstances, the employing office shall inform the employee at the same time it issues the designation notice that for each subsequent instance of intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employee will be required to submit a fitness-for-duty certification unless one has already been submitted within the past 30 days. Alternatively, an employing office can set a different interval for requiring a fitness-for-duty certification as long as it does not exceed once every 30 days and as long as the employing office advises the employee of the requirement in advance of the employee taking the intermittent or reduced schedule leave. The employing office may not terminate the employment of the employee while awaiting such a certification of fitness to return to duty for an intermittent or reduced schedule leave absence. Reasonable safety concerns means a reasonable belief of significant risk of harm to the individual employee or others. In determining whether reasonable safety concerns exist, an employing office should consider the nature and severity of the potential harm and the likelihood that potential harm will occur.\n(g)If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement govern an employee’s return to work, those provisions shall be applied. (h)Requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by the CAA, apply. After an employee returns from FMLA leave, the ADA requires any medical examination at an employing office’s expense by the employing office’s health care provider be job-related and consistent with business necessity. For example, an attorney could not be required to submit to a medical examination or inquiry just because her leg had been amputated. The essential functions of an attorney’s job do not require use of both legs', ' therefore such an inquiry would not be job related. An employing office may require a warehouse laborer, whose back impairment affects the ability to lift, to be examined by an orthopedist, but may not require this employee to submit to an HIV test where the test is not related to either the essential functions of his or her job or to his/her impairment. If an employee’s serious health condition may also be a disability within the meaning of the ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, the FMLA does not prevent the employing office from following the procedures for requesting medical information under the ADA.\n825.313Failure to provide certification\n(a)Foreseeable leave. In the case of foreseeable leave, if an employee fails to provide certification in a timely manner as required by 825.305, then an employing office may deny FMLA coverage until the required certification is provided. For example, if an employee has 15 days to provide a certification and does not provide the certification for 45 days without sufficient reason for the delay, the employing office can deny FMLA protections for the 30-day period following the expiration of the 15-day time period, if the employee takes leave during such period. (b)Unforeseeable leave. In the case of unforeseeable leave, an employing office may deny FMLA coverage for the requested leave if the employee fails to provide a certification within 15 calendar days from receipt of the request for certification unless not practicable due to extenuating circumstances. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, it may not be practicable for an employee to provide the required certification within 15 calendar days. Absent such extenuating circumstances, if the employee fails to timely return the certification, the employing office can deny FMLA protections for the leave following the expiration of the 15-day time period until a sufficient certification is provided. If the employee never produces the certification, the leave is not FMLA leave.\n(c)Recertification. An employee must provide recertification within the time requested by the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the request) or as soon as practicable under the particular facts and circumstances. If an employee fails to provide a recertification within a reasonable time under the particular facts and circumstances, then the employing office may deny continuation of the FMLA leave protections until the employee produces a sufficient recertification. If the employee never produces the recertification, the leave is not FMLA leave. Recertification does not apply to leave taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember. (d)Fitness-for-duty certification. When requested by the employing office pursuant to a uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, the employee must provide medical certification, at the time the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave taken for the employee’s serious health condition, that the employee is fit for duty and able to return to work (see 825.312(a)) if the employing office has provided the required notice (see 825.300(e))', ' the employing office may delay restoration until the certification is provided. Unless the employee provides either a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also 825.213(a)(3).\nDAdministrative Process\n825.400Administrative process, general rules\n(a)The Procedural Rules of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights set forth the procedures that apply to the administrative process for considering and resolving alleged violations of the laws made applicable by the CAA, including the FMLA. The Rules include procedures for filing claims and participating in administrative dispute resolution proceedings at the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, including procedures for the conduct of hearings and for appeals to the Board of Directors. The Procedural Rules also address other matters of general applicability to the dispute resolution process and to the operations of the Office. (b)If an employing office has violated one or more provisions of FMLA, as incorporated by the CAA, and if justified by the facts of a particular case, an employee may receive one or more of the following: wages, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation', ' or, where no such tangible loss has occurred, such as when FMLA leave was unlawfully denied, any actual monetary loss sustained by the employee as a direct result of the violation, such as the cost of providing care, up to a sum equal to 26 weeks of wages for the employee in a case involving leave to care for a covered servicemember or 12 weeks of wages for the employee in a case involving leave for any other FMLA qualifying reason. In addition, the employee may be entitled to interest on such sum, calculated at the prevailing rate. An amount equaling the preceding sums may also be awarded as liquidated damages unless such amount is reduced by the hearing officer or the Board because the violation was in good faith and the employing office had reasonable grounds for believing the employer had not violated the CAA. When appropriate, the employee may also obtain appropriate equitable relief, such as employment, reinstatement and promotion. When the employing office is found in violation, the employee may recover a reasonable attorney’s fee, reasonable expert witness fees, and other costs as would be appropriate if awarded under section 2000e–5(k) of title 42.\n(c)The Procedural Rules of the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights are found at 165 Cong. Rec. H4896 (daily ed. June 19, 2019) and 165 Cong. Rec. S4105 (daily ed. June 19, 2019), and may also be found on the Office’s website at www.ocwr.gov. 825.401Reserved 825.402Reserved 825.403Reserved 825.404Reserved EReserved FSpecial Rules Applicable to Employees of Schools 825.600Special rules for school employees, definitions (a)Certain special rules apply to employees of local educational agencies, including public school boards and elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n(b)Educational institutions are covered by FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual requirements for employees to be eligible do apply. (c)The special rules affect the taking of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the end of an academic term (semester), by instructional employees. Instructional employees are those whose principal function is to teach and instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving instructors, and special education assistants such as signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and the special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It also does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, or bus drivers.\n(d)Special rules which apply to restoration to an equivalent position apply to all employees of local educational agencies. 825.601Special rules for school employees, limitations on intermittent leave (a)Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively rather than intermittently. The period during the summer vacation when the employee would not have been required to report for duty is not counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any benefits over the summer vacation that employees would normally receive if they had been working at the end of the school year.\n(1)If an eligible instructional employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to care for a family member with a serious health condition, to care for a covered servicemember, or for the employee’s own serious health condition, which is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for more than 20 percent of the total number of working days over the period the leave would extend, the employing office may require the employee to choose either to: (A)Take leave for a period or periods of a particular duration, not greater than the duration of the planned treatment', ' or\n(B)Transfer temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified, which has equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the employee’s regular position.  (2)These rules apply only to a leave involving more than 20 percent of the working days during the period over which the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee who normally works five days each week needs to take two days of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the leave period would not be subject to transfer to an alternative position. Periods of a particular duration means a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier than the first day for which leave is needed and ending no later than the last day on which leave is needed, and may include one uninterrupted period of leave.\n(b)If an instructional employee does not give required notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (See 825.302) to be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the employing office may require the employee to take leave of a particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an alternative position. Alternatively, the employing office may require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the notice provision is met. 825.602Special rules for school employees, limitations on leave near the end of an academic term (a)There are also different rules for instructional employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules apply except in circumstances when:\n(1)An instructional employee begins leave more than five weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if— (A)The leave will last at least three weeks, and \n(B)The employee would return to work during the three-week period before the end of the term. (2)The employee begins leave during the five-week period before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or daughter', ' the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care', ' to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition', ' or to care for a covered servicemember. The employing office may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if—\n(A)The leave will last more than two weeks, and  (B)The employee would return to work during the two-week period before the end of the term.\n(3)The employee begins leave during the three-week period before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or daughter', ' the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care', ' to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition', ' or to care for a covered servicemember. The employing office may require the employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term if the leave will last more than five working days. (b)For purposes of these provisions, academic term means the school semester, which typically ends near the end of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or semesters each year for purposes of FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of leave to care for a family member which will begin three weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the employing office could require the employee to stay out on leave until the end of the term.\n825.603Special rules for school employees, duration of FMLA leave\n(a)If an employee chooses to take leave for periods of a particular duration in the case of intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count as FMLA leave. (b)In the case of an employee who is required to take leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work shall be charged against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. The employing office has the option not to require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the employing office to the end of the school term is not counted as FMLA leave', ' however, the employing office shall be required to maintain the employee’s group health insurance and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n825.604Special rules for school employees, restoration to an equivalent position The determination of how an employee is to be restored to an equivalent position upon return from FMLA leave will be made on the basis of established school board policies and practices, private school policies and practices, and collective bargaining agreements. The established policies and collective bargaining agreements used as a basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must clearly explain the employee’s restoration rights upon return from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis for restoration of an employee to an equivalent position must provide substantially the same protections as provided in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated employees. See 825.215. In other words, the policy or collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. For example, an employee may not be restored to a position requiring additional licensure or certification. GEffect of Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, and Collective Bargaining Agreements on Employee Rights Under the FMLA, As Made Applicable By the CAA 825.700Interaction with employing office’s policies (a)An employing office must observe any employment benefit program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the additional leave period not covered by FMLA.\n(b)Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous leave policies. 825.701Reserved\n825.702Interaction with anti-discrimination laws, as applied by section 201 of the CAA\n(a)Nothing in the FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and as made applicable by the CAA). FMLA’s legislative history explains that FMLA is not intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [as amended] or the regulations issued under that act. Thus, the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the [ADA] . . . or the Federal government itself. The purpose of the FMLA, as applied by the CAA, is to make leave available to eligible employees and [employing offices] within its coverage, and not to limit already existing rights and protection. S. Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). An employing office must therefore provide leave under whichever statutory provision provides the greater rights to employees. When an employer violates both FMLA and a discrimination law, an employee may be able to recover under either or both statutes (double relief may not be awarded for the same loss', ' when remedies coincide a claimant may be allowed to utilize whichever avenue of relief is desired. Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 567 F.2d 429, 445 (D.C. Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086 (1978). (b)If an employee is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA, the employing office must make reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights, as made applicable by the CAA. ADA’s disability and FMLA’s serious health condition are different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-month period due to their own serious health condition, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount of leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable accommodation. FMLA requires employing offices to maintain employees’ group health plan coverage during FMLA leave on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the leave period, whereas ADA does not require maintenance of health insurance unless other employees receive health insurance during leave under the same circumstances.\n(c)\n(1)A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be accomplished by providing an individual with a disability with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant position only if the employee cannot perform the essential functions of the employee’s present position and an accommodation is not possible in the employee’s present position, or an accommodation in the employee’s present position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual with a disability. (2)A qualified individual with a disability who is also an eligible employee entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which the employing office grants because it is not an undue hardship. The employing office advises the employee that the 10 weeks of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and will count towards the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. This designation does not prevent the parties from also treating the leave as a reasonable accommodation and reinstating the employee into the same job, as required by the ADA, rather than an equivalent position under FMLA, if that is the greater right available to the employee. At the same time, the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have the employing office maintain group health plan coverage during the leave, as that requirement provides the greater right to the employee.\n(3)If the same employee needed to work part-time (a reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time employees do not receive health insurance. This employee would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, the FMLA’s provision for temporary assignment to a different alternative position would not apply. Once the employee has exhausted his or her remaining FMLA leave entitlement while working the reduced (part-time) schedule, if the employee is a qualified individual with a disability, and if the employee is unable to return to the same full-time position at that time, the employee might continue to work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, barring undue hardship', ' the employee would then be entitled to only those employment benefits ordinarily provided by the employing office to part-time employees. (4)At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and benefits, to that which the employee held when leave commenced. The employing office’s FMLA obligations would be satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to perform the essential functions of that equivalent position even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant position, barring undue hardship.\n(d)\n(1)If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an employee the opportunity to take such a position. An employing office may not change the essential functions of the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See 825.220(b). (2)An employee may be on a workers’ compensation absence due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers’ compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing office). At some point the health care provider providing medical care pursuant to the workers’ compensation injury may certify the employee is able to return to work in a light duty position. If the employing office offers such a position, the employee is permitted but not required to accept the position. See 825.220(d). As a result, the employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers’ compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted. See 825.207(e). If the employee returning from the workers’ compensation injury is a qualified individual with a disability, he or she will have rights under the ADA, as made applicable by the CAA.\n(e)If an employing office requires certifications of an employee’s fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related and consistent with business necessity. (f)Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing office provides to other employees with short-term disabilities. Because Title VII does not require employees to be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an employee employed for less than 12 months by the employing office may not be denied maternity leave if the employing office normally provides short-term disability benefits to employees with the same tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n(g)Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et seq., veterans are entitled to receive all rights and benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they had been continuously employed. Therefore, under USERRA, a returning servicemember would be eligible for FMLA leave if the months and hours that he or she would have worked for the civilian employing office during the period of absence due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service, combined with the months employed and the hours actually worked, meet the FMLA eligibility threshold of 12 months of employment and the hours of service requirement. See 825.110(b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) and 825.802(c).

(b)Regulations approvedThe regulations described in this subsection are the regulations issued by the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights on September 28, 2022, under section 203(c)(2) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to implement section 203 of such Act (relating to the application of overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938), as published in the Congressional Record on September 28, 2022 (Volume 168, daily edition) on pages H8203 through H8217, and stated as follows:\n\n541Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, and Computer and Outside Sales Employees\nAGeneral Regulations (§§541.0-541.4)\n541.0Introductory statement\n(a)Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, provides an exemption from the Act’s minimum wage and overtime requirements for any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity (including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools), or in the capacity of an outside sales employee, as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.<< and applies to covered employees by virtue of section 225(e)(1) of the CAA, as amended, 2 U.S.C. 1361(e)(1).>> Section 13(a)(17) of the Act provides an exemption from the minimum wage and overtime requirements for computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other similarly skilled computer employees << and applies to covered employees by virtue of section 225(e)(1) of the CAA, as amended, 2 U.S.C. 1361(e)(1)>>. (b)The requirements for these exemptions are contained in this part as follows: executive employees, subpart B', ' administrative employees, subpart C', ' professional employees, subpart D', ' computer employees, subpart E', ' outside sales employees, subpart F. Subpart G contains regulations regarding salary requirements applicable to most of the exemptions, including salary levels and the salary basis test. Subpart G also contains a provision for exempting certain highly compensated employees. Subpart H contains definitions and other miscellaneous provisions applicable to all or several of the exemptions.\n(c)Effective July 1, 1972, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to include within the protection of the equal pay provisions those employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and professional employees (including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools), or in the capacity of an outside sales employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act. The equal pay provisions in section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act are administered and enforced by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<<Office of Congressional Workplace Rights>>. 541.1Terms used in regulationsAct means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor. The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions vested in the Secretary under sections 13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. <<CAA means Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, as amended. Office means the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. Employee means a covered employee as defined in section 101(a)(3) through (a)(8) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1301(a)(3) through (a)(8), but not an intern as defined in section 203(a)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1313(a)(2). Employer, company, business, or enterprise each mean an employing office as defined in section 101(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1301(a)(9).>>\n541.2Job titles insufficientA job title alone is insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. The exempt or nonexempt status of any particular employee must be determined on the basis of whether the employee’s salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations in this part. 541.3Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemptions (a)The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations in this part do not apply to manual laborers or other blue collar workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. Such nonexempt blue collar employees gain the skills and knowledge required for performance of their routine manual and physical work through apprenticeships and on-the-job training, not through the prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction required for exempt learned professional employees such as medical doctors, architects and archeologists. Thus, for example, non-management production-line employees and non-management employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and are not exempt under the regulations in this part no matter how highly paid they might be.\n(b)\n(1)The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations in this part also do not apply to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators, inspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank or pay level, who perform work such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires of any type', ' rescuing fire, crime or accident victims', ' preventing or detecting crimes', ' conducting investigations or inspections for violations of law', ' performing surveillance', ' pursuing, restraining and apprehending suspects', ' detaining or supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including those on probation or parole', ' interviewing witnesses', ' interrogating and fingerprinting suspects', ' preparing investigative reports', ' or other similar work. (2)Such employees do not qualify as exempt executive employees because their primary duty is not management of the enterprise <<employing office>> in which the employee is employed or a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof as required under §541.100. Thus, for example, a police officer or fire fighter whose primary duty is to investigate crimes or fight fires is not exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act merely because the police officer or fire fighter also directs the work of other employees in the conduct of an investigation or fighting a fire.\n(3)Such employees do not qualify as exempt administrative employees because their primary duty is not the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s customers<<, constituents or stakeholders>> as required under §541.200. (4)Such employees do not qualify as exempt professionals because their primary duty is not the performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as required under §541.300. Although some police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and similar employees have college degrees, a specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for employment in such occupations. \n541.4Other laws and collective bargaining agreementsThe Fair Labor Standards Act provides minimum standards that may be exceeded, but cannot be waived or reduced. Employers must comply, for example, with any Federal, State or municipal laws, regulations or ordinances establishing a higher minimum wage or lower maximum workweek than those established under the Act. Similarly, employers, on their own initiative or under a collective bargaining agreement with a labor union, are not precluded by the Act from providing a wage higher than the statutory minimum, a shorter workweek than the statutory maximum, or a higher overtime premium (double time, for example) than provided by the Act. While collective bargaining agreements cannot waive or reduce the Act’s protections, nothing in the Act or the regulations in this part relieves employers from their contractual obligations under collective bargaining agreements. BExecutive Employees (§§541.100-541.106) 541.100General rule for executive employees (a)The term employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:\n(1)Compensated on a salary basis pursuant to §541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities', ' (2)Whose primary duty is management of the enterprise <<employing office>> in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof', '\n(3)Who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees', ' and (4)Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.\n(b)The phrase salary basis is defined at §541.602', ' board, lodging or other facilities is defined at §541.606', ' primary duty is defined at §541.700', ' and customarily and regularly is defined at §541.701. 541.101Business ownerThe term employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes any employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which the employee is employed, regardless of whether the business is a corporate or other type of organization, and who is actively engaged in its management. The term management is defined in §541.102. The requirements of Subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the business owners described in this section.\n541.102ManagementGenerally, management includes, but is not limited to, activities such as interviewing, selecting, and training of employees', ' setting and adjusting their rates of pay and hours of work', ' directing the work of employees', ' maintaining production or sales records for use in supervision or control', ' appraising employees’ productivity and efficiency for the purpose of recommending promotions or other changes in status', ' handling employee complaints and grievances', ' disciplining employees', ' planning the work', ' determining the techniques to be used', ' apportioning the work among the employees', ' determining the type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment or tools to be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold', ' controlling the flow and distribution of materials or merchandise and supplies', ' providing for the safety and security of the employees or the property', ' planning and controlling the budget', ' and monitoring or implementing legal compliance measures. 541.103Department or subdivision (a)The phrase a customarily recognized department or subdivision is intended to distinguish between a mere collection of employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or series of jobs and a unit with permanent status and function. A customarily recognized department or subdivision must have a permanent status and a continuing function. For example, a large employer’s human resources department might have subdivisions for labor relations, pensions and other benefits, equal employment opportunity, and personnel management, each of which has a permanent status and function.\n(b)When an enterprise <<employing office>> has more than one establishment <<location>>, the employee in charge of each establishment <<location>> may be considered in charge of a recognized subdivision of the enterprise <<employing office>>. (c)A recognized department or subdivision need not be physically within the employer’s establishment and may move from place to place. The mere fact that the employee works in more than one location does not invalidate the exemption if other factors show that the employee is actually in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing function in the organization.\n(d)Continuity of the same subordinate personnel is not essential to the existence of a recognized unit with a continuing function. An otherwise exempt employee will not lose the exemption merely because the employee draws and supervises workers from a pool or supervises a team of workers drawn from other recognized units, if other factors are present that indicate that the employee is in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing function. 541.104Two or more other employees (a)To qualify as an exempt executive under §541.100, the employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees. The phrase two or more other employees means two full-time employees or their equivalent. One full-time and two half-time employees, for example, are equivalent to two full-time employees. Four half-time employees are also equivalent.\n(b)The supervision can be distributed among two, three or more employees, but each such employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the equivalent. Thus, for example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers may have up to two exempt supervisors if each such supervisor customarily and regularly directs the work of two of those workers. (c)An employee who merely assists the manager of a particular department and supervises two or more employees only in the actual manager’s absence does not meet this requirement.\n(d)Hours worked by an employee cannot be credited more than once for different executives. Thus, a shared responsibility for the supervision of the same two employees in the same department does not satisfy this requirement. However, a full-time employee who works four hours for one supervisor and four hours for a different supervisor, for example, can be credited as a half-time employee for both supervisors. 541.105Particular weightTo determine whether an employee’s suggestions and recommendations are given particular weight, factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee’s job duties to make such suggestions and recommendations', ' the frequency with which such suggestions and recommendations are made or requested', ' and the frequency with which the employee’s suggestions and recommendations are relied upon. Generally, an executive’s suggestions and recommendations must pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and regularly directs. It does not include an occasional suggestion with regard to the change in status of a co-worker. An employee’s suggestions and recommendations may still be deemed to have particular weight even if a higher level manager’s recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee’s change in status.\n541.106Concurrent duties\n(a)Concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt work does not disqualify an employee from the executive exemption if the requirements of §541.100 are otherwise met. Whether an employee meets the requirements of §541.100 when the employee performs concurrent duties is determined on a case-by-case basis and based on the factors set forth in §541.700. Generally, exempt executives make the decision regarding when to perform nonexempt duties and remain responsible for the success or failure of business operations under their management while performing the nonexempt work. In contrast, the nonexempt employee generally is directed by a supervisor to perform the exempt work or performs the exempt work for defined time periods. An employee whose primary duty is ordinary production work or routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot qualify for exemption as an executive. (b)For example, an assistant manager in a retail establishment may perform work such as serving customers, cooking food, stocking shelves and cleaning the establishment, but performance of such nonexempt work does not preclude the exemption if the assistant manager’s primary duty is management. An assistant manager can supervise employees and serve customers at the same time without losing the exemption. An exempt employee can also simultaneously direct the work of other employees and stock shelves.\n(c)In contrast, a relief supervisor or working supervisor whose primary duty is performing nonexempt work on the production line in a manufacturing plant does not become exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work of other nonexempt production line employees when, for example, the exempt supervisor is unavailable. Similarly, an employee whose primary duty is to work as an electrician is not an exempt executive even if the employee also directs the work of other employees on the job site, orders parts and materials for the job, and handles requests from the prime contractor. CAdministrative Employees (§§541.200-541.204) 541.200General rule for administrative employees (a)The term employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:\n(1)Compensated on a salary or fee basis pursuant to §541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities', ' (2)Whose primary duty is the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s customers<<, constituents or stakeholders>>', ' and\n(3)Whose primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. (b)The term salary basis is defined at §541.602', ' fee basis is defined at §541.605', ' board, lodging or other facilities is defined at §541.606', ' and primary duty is defined at §541.700. \n541.201Directly related to management or general business operations\n(a)To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer’s customers<<, constituents or stakeholders>>. The phrase directly related to the management or general business operations refers to the type of work performed by the employee. To meet this requirement, an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the [business] <<employing office>>, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment. (b)Work directly related to management or general business operations includes, but is not limited to, work in functional areas such as tax', ' finance', ' accounting', ' budgeting', ' auditing', ' insurance', ' quality control', ' purchasing', ' procurement', ' advertising', ' marketing', ' research', ' safety and health', ' personnel management', ' human resources', ' employee benefits', ' labor relations', ' public relations, government relations', ' computer network, internet and database administration', ' legal and regulatory compliance', ' and similar activities. Some of these activities may be performed by employees who also would qualify for another exemption.\n(c)An employee may qualify for the administrative exemption if the employee’s primary duty is the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer’s customers<<, constituents and/or stakeholders>>. Thus, for example, employees acting as advisers or consultants to their employer’s clients or customer<<, constituents or stakeholders>> (as tax experts or financial consultants, for example) may be exempt. 541.202Discretion and independent judgment (a)To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee’s primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered. The term matters of significance refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.\n(b)The phrase discretion and independent judgment must be applied in the light of all the facts involved in the particular employment situation in which the question arises. Factors to consider when determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance include, but are not limited to: whether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or implement management policies or operating practices', ' whether the employee carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business <<employing office>>', ' whether the employee performs work that affects business operations <<of the employing office>>to a substantial degree, even if the employee’s assignments are related to operation of a particular segment of the business <<employing office>>', ' whether the employee has authority to commit the employer in matters that have significant financial impact', ' whether the employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and procedures without prior approval', ' whether the employee has authority to negotiate and bind the company<<employing office>> on significant matters', ' whether the employee provides consultation or expert advice to management', ' whether the employee is involved in planning longer short-term business <<employing office>> objectives', ' whether the employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of management', ' and whether the employee represents the company<<employing office>> in handling complaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.  (c)The exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision. However, employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the term discretion and independent judgment does not require that the decisions made by an employee have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of review. The decisions made as a result of the exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action. The fact that an employee’s decision may be subject to review and that upon occasion the decisions are revised or reversed after review does not mean that the employee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment. For example, the policies formulated by the credit manager of a<<n>> large corporation<<employing office>> may be subject to review by higher company<<employing office>> officials who may approve or disapprove these policies. The management consultant <<department director>> who has made a study of the operations of a business <<department>> and who has drawn a proposed change in organization may have the plan reviewed or revised by superiors before it is submitted to the client<<approved>>.\n(d)An employer’s volume of business <<work>> may make it necessary to employ a number of employees to perform the same or similar work. The fact that many employees perform identical work or work of the same relative importance does not mean that the work of each such employee does not involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. (e)The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources. See also §541.704 regarding use of manuals. The exercise of discretion and independent judgment also does not include clerical or secretarial work, recording or tabulating data, or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. An employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt, even if labeled as a statistician.\n(f)An employee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly. For example, a messenger who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance even though serious consequences may flow from the employee’s neglect. Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because improper performance of the employee’s duties may cause serious financial loss to the employer. 541.203Administrative exemption examples (a)Insurance claims adjusters<<Employees who investigate claims>> generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an insurance company or other type of company, if their duties include activities such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians', ' inspecting property damage', ' reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates', ' evaluating and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims', ' determining liability and total value of a claim', ' negotiating settlements', ' and making recommendations regarding litigation.\n(b)Employees in the financial services industry generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the customer’s income, assets, investments or debts', ' determining which financial products best meet the customer’s needs and financial circumstances', ' advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products', ' and marketing, servicing or promoting the employer’s financial products. However, an employee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption. (c)An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to complete major projects for the employer (such as purchasing, selling or closing all or part of the business, negotiating a real estate transaction or a collective bargaining agreement, or designing and implementing productivity improvements) generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption, even if the employee does not have direct supervisory responsibility over the other employees on the team.\n(d)An executive assistant or administrative assistant to a business owner or senior executive of a large business<<senior management official of an employing office>> generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated authority regarding matters of significance. (e)Human resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement employment policies and management consultants who study the operations of a business <<employing office>> and propose changes in organization generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. However, personnel clerks who screen applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications and fitness for employment generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Such personnel clerks typically will reject all applicants who do not meet minimum standards for the particular job or for employment by the company <<employing office>>. The minimum standards are usually set by the exempt human resources manager or other company <<employing office>> officials, and the decision to hire from the group of qualified applicants who do meet the minimum standards is similarly made by the exempt human resources manager or other company <<employing office>> officials. Thus, when the interviewing and screening functions are performed by the human resources manager or personnel manager who makes the hiring decision or makes recommendations for hiring from the pool of qualified applicants, such duties constitute exempt work, even though routine, because this work is directly and closely related to the employee’s exempt functions. \n(f)Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company <<employing office>> on significant purchases generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption even if they must consult with top management officials when making a purchase commitment for raw materials in excess of the contemplated plant needs. (g)Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Inspectors normally perform specialized work along standardized lines involving well-established techniques and procedures which may have been catalogued and described in manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely on techniques and skills acquired by special training or experience. They have some leeway in the performance of their work but only within closely prescribed limits.\n(h)Employees usually called examiners or graders, such as employees that grade lumber, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Such employees usually perform work involving the comparison of products with established standards which are frequently catalogued. Often, after continued reference to the written standards, or through experience, the employee acquires sufficient knowledge so that reference to written standards is unnecessary. The substitution of the employee’s memory for a manual of standards does not convert the character of the work performed to exempt work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment. (i)Comparison shopping performed by an employee of a retail store who merely reports to the buyer the prices at a competitor’s store does not qualify for the administrative exemption. However, the buyer who evaluates such reports on competitor prices to set the employer’s prices generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.<<Reserved.>>\n(j)Public sector i<<I>>nspectors or investigators of various types, such as fire prevention or safety, building or construction, health or sanitation, environmental or soils specialists and similar employees, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption because their work typically does not involve work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer. Such employees also do not qualify for the administrative exemption because their work involves the use of skills and technical abilities in gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met. 541.204Educational establishments (a)The term employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes employees:\n(1)Compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities', ' or on a salary basis which is at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational establishment by which employed', ' and (2)Whose primary duty is performing administrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training in an educational establishment or department or subdivision thereof.\n(b)The term educational establishment means an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other educational institution. Sections 3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary and secondary schools as those day or residential schools that provide elementary or secondary education, as determined under State law. Under the laws of most States, such education includes the curriculums in grades 1 through 12', ' under many it includes also the introductory programs in kindergarten. Such education in some States may also include nursery school programs in elementary education and junior college curriculums in secondary education. The term other educational establishment includes special schools for mentally or physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of such schools as elementary, secondary or higher. Factors relevant in determining whether post-secondary career programs are educational institutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency responsible for the state’s educational system or accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting organization for career schools. Also, for purposes of the exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or between those operated for profit and those that are not for profit. (c)The phrase performing administrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training means work related to the academic operations and functions in a school rather than to administration along the lines of general business operations. Such academic administrative functions include operations directly in the field of education. Jobs relating to areas outside the educational field are not within the definition of academic administration.\n(1)Employees engaged in academic administrative functions include: the superintendent or other head of an elementary or secondary school system, and any assistants, responsible for administration of such matters as curriculum, quality and methods of instructing, measuring and testing the learning potential and achievement of students, establishing and maintaining academic and grading standards, and other aspects of the teaching program', ' the principal and any vice-principals responsible for the operation of an elementary or secondary school', ' department heads in institutions of higher education responsible for the administration of the mathematics department, the English department, the foreign language department, etc.', ' academic counselors who perform work such as administering school testing programs, assisting students with academic problems and advising students concerning degree requirements', ' and other employees with similar responsibilities. (2)Jobs relating to building management and maintenance, jobs relating to the health of the students, and academic staff such as social workers, psychologists, lunch room managers or dietitians do not perform academic administrative functions. Although such work is not considered academic administration, such employees may qualify for exemption under §541.200 or under other sections of this part, provided the requirements for such exemptions are met.\nDProfessional Employees (§§541.300-541.304)\n541.300General rule for professional employees\n(a)The term employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee: (1)Compensated on a salary or fee basis pursuant to §541.600 at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities', ' and\n(2)Whose primary duty is the performance of work: (i)Requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction', ' or \n(ii)Requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor. (b)The term salary basis is defined at §541.602', ' fee basis is defined at §541.605', ' board, lodging or other facilities is defined at §541.606', ' and primary duty is defined at §541.700. \n541.301Learned professionals\n(a)To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. This primary duty test includes three elements: (1)The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge', '\n(2)The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning', ' and (3)The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.\n(b)The phrase work requiring advanced knowledge means work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. An employee who performs work requiring advanced knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school level. (c)The phrase field of science or learning includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status as distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science or learning.\n(d)The phrase customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction restricts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession. The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree. However, the word customarily means that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who attained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual instruction. Thus, for example, the learned professional exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school, or the occasional chemist who is not the possessor of a degree in chemistry. However, the learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that customarily may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes. The learned professional exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual instruction. (e) (1)Registered or certified medical technologists. Registered or certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three academic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.\n(2)Nurses. Registered nurses who are registered by the appropriate State examining board generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. Licensed practical nurses and other similar health care employees, however, generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because possession of a specialized advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into such occupations. (3)Dental hygienists. Dental hygienists who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study in an accredited college or university approved by the Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational Programs of the American Dental Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.\n(4)Physician assistants. Physician assistants who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study, including graduation from a physician assistant program accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, and who are certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. (5)Accountants. Certified public accountants generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. In addition, many other accountants who are not certified public accountants but perform similar job duties may qualify as exempt learned professionals. However, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as exempt professionals.\n(6)Chefs. Chefs, such as executive chefs and sous chefs, who have attained a four-year specialized academic degree in a culinary arts program, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. The learned professional exemption is not available to cooks who perform predominantly routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. (7)Paralegals. Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs are two-year associate degree programs from a community college or equivalent institution. However, the learned professional exemption is available for paralegals who possess advanced specialized degrees in other professional fields and apply advanced knowledge in that field in the performance of their duties. For example, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent matters, that engineer would qualify for exemption.\n(8)Athletic trainers. Athletic trainers who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study in a specialized curriculum accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs and who are certified by the Board of Certification of the National Athletic Trainers Association Board of Certification generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. (9)Funeral directors or embalmers. Licensed funeral directors and embalmers who are licensed by and working in a state that requires successful completion of four academic years of pre-professional and professional study, including graduation from a college of mortuary science accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.\n(f)The areas in which the professional exemption may be available are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic training is broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and certifying organizations similar to those listed in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(8) of this section also may be created in the future. Such organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned profession. 541.302Creative professionals (a)To qualify for the creative professional exemption, an employee’s primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. The exemption does not apply to work which can be produced by a person with general manual or intellectual ability and training.\n(b)To qualify for exemption as a creative professional, the work performed must be in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor. This includes such fields as music, writing, acting and the graphic arts. (c)The requirement of invention, imagination, originality or talent distinguishes the creative professions from work that primarily depends on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. The duties of employees vary widely, and exemption as a creative professional depends on the extent of the invention, imagination, originality or talent exercised by the employee. Determination of exempt creative professional status, therefore, must be made on a case-by-case basis. This requirement generally is met by actors, musicians, composers, conductors, and soloists', ' painters who at most are given the subject matter of their painting', ' cartoonists who are merely told the title or underlying concept of a cartoon and must rely on their own creative ability to express the concept', ' essayists, novelists, short-story writers and screen-play writers who choose their own subjects and hand in a finished piece of work to their employers (the majority of such persons are, of course, not employees but self-employed)', ' and persons holding the more responsible writing positions in advertising agencies. This requirement generally is not met by a person who is employed as a copyist, as an animator of motion-picture cartoons, or as a retoucher of photographs, since such work is not properly described as creative in character.\n(d)Journalists may satisfy the duties requirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as opposed to work which depends primarily on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. Employees of newspapers, magazines, television and other media are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect, organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product. Thus, for example, newspaper reporters who merely rewrite press releases or who write standard recounts of public information by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt creative professionals. Reporters also do not qualify as exempt creative professionals if their work product is subject to substantial control by the employer. However, journalists may qualify as exempt creative professionals if their primary duty is performing on the air in radio, television or other electronic media', ' conducting investigative interviews', ' analyzing or interpreting public events', ' writing editorials, opinion columns or other commentary', ' or acting as a narrator or commentator. 541.303Teachers (a)The term employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also means any employee with a primary duty of teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational establishment by which the employee is employed. The term educational establishment is defined in §541.204(b).\n(b)Exempt teachers include, but are not limited to: Regular academic teachers', ' teachers of kindergarten or nursery school pupils', ' teachers of gifted or disabled children', ' teachers of skilled and semi-skilled trades and occupations', ' teachers engaged in automobile driving instruction', ' aircraft flight instructors', ' home economics teachers', ' and vocal or instrumental music instructors. Those faculty members who are engaged as teachers but also spend a considerable amount of their time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic teams or acting as moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate or journalism are engaged in teaching. Such activities are a recognized part of the schools’ responsibility in contributing to the educational development of the student. (c)The possession of an elementary or secondary teacher’s certificate provides a clear means of identifying the individuals contemplated as being within the scope of the exemption for teaching professionals. Teachers who possess a teaching certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g., permanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or unlimited) used by the State to refer to different kinds of certificates. However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in requiring a certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher, and a teacher’s certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions of higher education or other educational establishments. Therefore, a teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption, provided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school or school system.\n(d)The requirements of §541.300 and Subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the teaching professionals described in this section. 541.304Practice of law or medicine (a)The term employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also shall mean:\n(1)Any employee who is the holder of a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or medicine or any of their branches and is actually engaged in the practice thereof', ' and (2)Any employee who is the holder of the requisite academic degree for the general practice of medicine and is engaged in an internship or resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession.\n(b)In the case of medicine, the exemption applies to physicians and other practitioners licensed and practicing in the field of medical science and healing or any of the medical specialties practiced by physicians or practitioners. The term physicians includes medical doctors including general practitioners and specialists, osteopathic physicians (doctors of osteopathy), podiatrists, dentists (doctors of dental medicine), and optometrists (doctors of optometry or bachelors of science in optometry). (c)Employees engaged in internship or resident programs, whether or not licensed to practice prior to commencement of the program, qualify as exempt professionals if they enter such internship or resident programs after the earning of the appropriate degree required for the general practice of their profession.\n(d)The requirements of §541.300 and subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the employees described in this section. EComputer Employees (§§541.400-541.402) 541.400General rule for computer employees (a)Computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers or other similarly skilled workers in the computer field are eligible for exemption as professionals under section 13(a)(1) of the Act and under section 13(a)(17) of the Act. Because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the applicability of this exemption.\n(b)The section 13(a)(1)exemption applies to any computer employee who is compensated on a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal government), exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities. The section 13(a)(17) exemption applies to any computer employee compensated on an hourly basis at a rate of not less than $27.63 an hour. In addition, under either section 13(a)(1) or section 13(a)(17) of the Act, the exemptions apply only to computer employees whose primary duty consists of:\n(1)The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications', ' (2)The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications', '\n(3)The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems', ' or (4)A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.\n(c)The term salary basis is defined at §541.602', ' fee basis is defined at §541.605', ' board, lodging or other facilities is defined at §541.606', ' and primary duty is defined at §541.700. 541.401Computer manufacture and repairThe exemption for employees in computer occupations does not include employees engaged in the manufacture or repair of computer hardware and related equipment. Employees whose work is highly dependent upon, or facilitated by, the use of computers and computer software programs (e.g., engineers, drafters and others skilled in computer-aided design software), but who are not primarily engaged in computer systems analysis and programming or other similarly skilled computer-related occupations identified in §541.400(b), are also not exempt computer professionals. \n541.402Executive and administrative computer employeesComputer employees within the scope of this exemption, as well as those employees not within its scope, may also have executive and administrative duties which qualify the employees for exemption under subpart B or subpart C of this part. For example, systems analysts and computer programmers generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their primary duty includes work such as planning, scheduling, and coordinating activities required to develop systems to solve complex business, scientific or engineering problems of the employer or the employer’s customers<<, constituents or stakeholders>>. Similarly, a senior or lead computer programmer who manages the work of two or more other programmers in a customarily recognized department or subdivision of the employer, and whose recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or other change of status of the other programmers are given particular weight, generally meets the duties requirements for the executive exemption. F<<Reserved>> FOutside Sales Employees (§§541.500-541.504) 541.500General rule for outside sales employees (a)The term employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:\n(1)Whose primary duty is: (i)making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or\n(ii)obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer', ' and  (2)Who is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer’s place or places of business in performing such primary duty.\n(b)The term primary duty is defined at §541.700. In determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee, work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside sales or solicitations, including incidental deliveries and collections, shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work. Other work that furthers the employee’s sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work including, for example, writing sales reports, updating or revising the employee’s sales or display catalogue, planning itineraries and attending sales conferences. (c)The requirements of subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the outside sales employees described in this section.\n541.501Making sales or obtaining orders\n(a)Section 541.500 requires that the employee be engaged in: (1)Making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or\n(2)Obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities. (b)Sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act include the transfer of title to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property. Section 3(k) of the Act states that sale or sell includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.\n(c)Exempt outside sales work includes not only the sales of commodities, but also obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer. Obtaining orders for the use of facilities includes the selling of time on radio or television, the solicitation of advertising for newspapers and other periodicals, and the solicitation of freight for railroads and other transportation agencies. (d)The word services extends the outside sales exemption to employees who sell or take orders for a service, which may be performed for the customer by someone other than the person taking the order.\n541.502Away from employer’s place of businessAn outside sales employee must be customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer’s place or places of business. The outside sales employee is an employee who makes sales at the customer’s place of business or, if selling door-to-door, at the customer’s home. Outside sales does not include sales made by mail, telephone or the Internet unless such contact is used merely as an adjunct to personal calls. Thus, any fixed site, whether home or office, used by a salesperson as a headquarters or for telephonic solicitation of sales is considered one of the employer’s places of business, even though the employer is not in any formal sense the owner or tenant of the property. However, an outside sales employee does not lose the exemption by displaying samples in hotel sample rooms during trips from city to city', ' these sample rooms should not be considered as the employer’s places of business. Similarly, an outside sales employee does not lose the exemption by displaying the employer’s products at a trade show. If selling actually occurs, rather than just sales promotion, trade shows of short duration (i.e., one or two weeks) should not be considered as the employer’s place of business. 541.503Promotion work (a)Promotion work is one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales, which may or may not be exempt outside sales work, depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed. Promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee’s own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work. On the other hand, promotional work that is incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not exempt outside sales work. An employee who does not satisfy the requirements of this subpart may still qualify as an exempt employee under other subparts of this rule.\n(b)A manufacturer’s representative, for example, may perform various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and posters, removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant’s shelves or rearranging the merchandise. Such an employee can be considered an exempt outside sales employee if the employee’s primary duty is making sales or contracts. Promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee’s own sales are exempt. Promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work. (c)Another example is a company representative who visits chain stores, arranges the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock by replacing old with new merchandise, sets up displays and consults with the store manager when inventory runs low, but does not obtain a commitment for additional purchases. The arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside sales. Because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt outside sales work.\n541.504Drivers who sell\n(a)Drivers who deliver products and also sell such products may qualify as exempt outside sales employees only if the employee has a primary duty of making sales. In determining the primary duty of drivers who sell, work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee’s own outside sales or solicitations, including loading, driving or delivering products, shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work. (b)Several factors should be considered in determining if a driver has a primary duty of making sales, including, but not limited to: a comparison of the driver’s duties with those of other employees engaged as truck drivers and as salespersons', ' possession of a selling or solicitor’s license when such license is required by law or ordinances', ' presence or absence of customary or contractual arrangements concerning amounts of products to be delivered', ' description of the employee’s occupation in collective bargaining agreements', ' the employer’s specifications as to qualifications for hiring', ' sales training', ' attendance at sales conferences', ' method of payment', ' and proportion of earnings directly attributable to sales.\n(c)Drivers who may qualify as exempt outside sales employees include: (1)A driver who provides the only sales contact between the employer and the customers visited, who calls on customers and takes orders for products, who delivers products from stock in the employee’s vehicle or procures and delivers the product to the customer on a later trip, and who receives compensation commensurate with the volume of products sold.\n(2)A driver who obtains or solicits orders for the employer’s products from persons who have authority to commit the customer for purchases. (3)A driver who calls on new prospects for customers along the employee’s route and attempts to convince them of the desirability of accepting regular delivery of goods.\n(4)A driver who calls on established customers along the route and persuades regular customers to accept delivery of increased amounts of goods or of new products, even though the initial sale or agreement for delivery was made by someone else. (d)Drivers who generally would not qualify as exempt outside sales employees include:\n(1)A route driver whose primary duty is to transport products sold by the employer through vending machines and to keep such machines stocked, in good operating condition, and in good locations. (2)A driver who often calls on established customers day after day or week after week, delivering a quantity of the employer’s products at each call when the sale was not significantly affected by solicitations of the customer by the delivering driver or the amount of the sale is determined by the volume of the customer’s sales since the previous delivery.\n(3)A driver primarily engaged in making deliveries to customers and performing activities intended to promote sales by customers (including placing point-of-sale and other advertising materials, price stamping commodities, arranging merchandise on shelves, in coolers or in cabinets, rotating stock according to date, and cleaning and otherwise servicing display cases), unless such work is in furtherance of the driver’s own sales efforts. GSalary Requirements (§§541.600-541.607) 541.600Amount of salary required (a)To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative or professional employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $684 per week (or $455 per week if employed in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands by employers other than the Federal Government, or $380 per week if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities. Administrative and professional employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as defined in §541.605.\n(b)The required amount of compensation per week may be translated into equivalent amounts for periods longer than one week. For example, the $684-per-week requirement will be met if the employee is compensated biweekly on a salary basis of not less than $1,368, semimonthly on a salary basis of not less than $1,482, or monthly on a salary basis of not less than $2,964. However, the shortest period of payment that will meet this compensation requirement is one week. (c)In the case of academic administrative employees, the compensation requirement also may be met by compensation on a salary basis at a rate at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational establishment by which the employee is employed, as provided in §541.204(a)(1).\n(d)In the case of computer employees, the compensation requirement also may be met by compensation on an hourly basis at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour, as provided in §541.400(b). (e)In the case of professional employees, the compensation requirements in this section shall not apply to employees engaged as teachers (see §541.303)', ' employees who hold a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or medicine or any of their branches and are actually engaged in the practice thereof (see §541.304)', ' or to employees who hold the requisite academic degree for the general practice of medicine and are engaged in an internship or resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession (see §541.304). In the case of medical occupations, the exception from the salary or fee requirement does not apply to pharmacists, nurses, therapists, technologists, sanitarians, dietitians, social workers, psychologists, psychometrists, or other professions which service the medical profession.\n541.601Highly compensated employees\n(a)\n(1)Beginning on January 1, 2020<<the effective date of these Substantive Regulations>>, an employee with total annual compensation of at least $107,432 is deemed exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act if the employee customarily and regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee as identified in subparts B, C or D of this part. (2)Where the annual period covers periods both prior to and after January 1, 2020<<the effective date of these Substantive Regulations>>, the amount of total annual compensation due will be determined on a proportional basis.\n(b)\n(1)Total annual compensation must include at least $684 per week paid on a salary or fee basis as set forth in §541.602 and 541.605, except that §541.602(a)(3) shall not apply to highly compensated employees. Total annual compensation may also include commissions, nondiscretionary bonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week period. Total annual compensation does not include board, lodging and other facilities as defined in §541.606, and does not include payments for medical insurance, payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement plans and the cost of other fringe benefits. (2)If an employee’s total annual compensation does not total at least the amount specified in the applicable subsection of paragraph (a) by the last pay period of the 52-week period, the employer may, during the last pay period or within one month after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment sufficient to achieve the required level. For example, for a 52-week period beginning January 1, 2020, an employee may earn $90,000 in base salary, and the employer may anticipate based upon past sales that the employee also will earn $17,432 in commissions<<other payments>>. However, due to poor sales in the final quarter of the year, the employee actually only earns $12,000 in commissions<<other payments>>. In this situation, the employer may within one month after the end of the year make a payment of at least $5,432 to the employee. Any such final payment made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year’s total annual compensation and not toward the total annual compensation in the year it was paid. If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee does not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may still qualify as exempt under subparts B, C, or D of this part.\n(3)An employee who does not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is newly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the end of the year, may qualify for exemption under this section if the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum amount established in paragraph (a) of this section, based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. An employer may make one final payment as under paragraph (b)(2) of this section within one month after the end of employment. (4)The employer may utilize any 52-week period as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will apply.\n(c)A high level of compensation is a strong indicator of an employee’s exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a detailed analysis of the employee’s job duties. Thus, a highly compensated employee will qualify for exemption if the employee customarily and regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee identified in subparts B, C or D of this part. An employee may qualify as a highly compensated executive employee, for example, if the employee customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees, even though the employee does not meet all of the other requirements for the executive exemption under §541.100. (d)This section applies only to employees whose primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work. Thus, for example, non-management production-line workers and non-management employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other employees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy are not exempt under this section no matter how highly paid they might be.\n541.602Salary basis\n(a)General rule. An employee will be considered to be paid on a salary basis within the meaning of this part if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee’s compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed. (1)Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked. Exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they perform no work.\n(2)An employee is not paid on a salary basis if deductions from the employee’s predetermined compensation are made for absences occasioned by the employer or by the operating requirements of the business <<employing office>>. If the employee is ready, willing and able to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available. (3)Up to ten percent of the salary amount required by §541.600(a) may be satisfied by the payment of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentives and commissions, that are paid annually or more frequently. The employer may utilize any 52-week period as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will apply. This provision does not apply to highly compensated employees under §541.601.\n(i)If by the last pay period of the 52-week period the sum of the employee’s weekly salary plus nondiscretionary bonus, incentive, and commission payments received is less than 52 times the weekly salary amount required by §541.600(a), the employer may make one final payment sufficient to achieve the required level no later than the next pay period after the end of the year. Any such final payment made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year’s salary amount and not toward the salary amount in the year it was paid.  (ii)An employee who does not work a full 52-week period for the employer, either because the employee is newly hired after the beginning of this period or ends the employment before the end of this period, may qualify for exemption if the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum amount established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. An employer may make one final payment as under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section within one pay period after the end of employment.\n(b)Exceptions. The prohibition against deductions from pay in the salary basis requirement is subject to the following exceptions: (1)Deductions from pay may be made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons, other than sickness or disability. Thus, if an employee is absent for two full days to handle personal affairs, the employee’s salaried status will not be affected if deductions are made from the salary for two full-day absences. However, if an exempt employee is absent for one and a half days for personal reasons, the employer can deduct only for the one full-day absence.\n(2)Deductions from pay may be made for absences of one or more full days occasioned by sickness or disability (including work-related accidents) if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for loss of salary occasioned by such sickness or disability. The employer is not required to pay any portion of the employee’s salary for full-day absences for which the employee receives compensation under the plan, policy or practice. Deductions for such full-day absences also may be made before the employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice, and after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance thereunder. Thus, for example, if an employer maintains a short-term disability insurance plan providing salary replacement for 12 weeks starting on the fourth day of absence, the employer may make deductions from pay for the three days of absence before the employee qualifies for benefits under the plan', ' for the twelve weeks in which the employee receives salary replacement benefits under the plan', ' and for absences after the employee has exhausted the 12 weeks of salary replacement benefits. Similarly, an employer may make deductions from pay for absences of one or more full days if salary replacement benefits are provided under a State disability insurance law or under a State workers’ compensation law. (3)While an employer cannot make deductions from pay for absences of an exempt employee occasioned by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave, the employer can offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, witness fees or military pay for a particular week against the salary due for that particular week without loss of the exemption.\n(4)Deductions from pay of exempt employees may be made for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance. Safety rules of major significance include those relating to the prevention of serious danger in the workplace or to other employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries and coal mines. (5)Deductions from pay of exempt employees may be made for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for infractions of workplace conduct rules. Such suspensions must be imposed pursuant to a written policy applicable to all employees. Thus, for example, an employer may suspend an exempt employee without pay for three days for violating a generally applicable written policy prohibiting sexual harassment. Similarly, an employer may suspend an exempt employee without pay for twelve days for violating a generally applicable written policy prohibiting workplace violence.\n(6)An employer is not required to pay the full salary in the initial or terminal week of employment. Rather, an employer may pay a proportionate part of an employee’s full salary for the time actually worked in the first and last week of employment. In such weeks, the payment of an hourly or daily equivalent of the employee’s full salary for the time actually worked will meet the requirement. However, employees are not paid on a salary basis within the meaning of these regulations if they are employed occasionally for a few days, and the employer pays them a proportionate part of the weekly salary when so employed. (7)An employer is not required to pay the full salary for weeks in which an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Rather, when an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer may pay a proportionate part of the full salary for time actually worked. For example, if an employee who normally works 40 hours per week uses four hours of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employer could deduct 10 percent of the employee’s normal salary that week.\n(c)When calculating the amount of a deduction from pay allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer may use the hourly or daily equivalent of the employee’s full weekly salary or any other amount proportional to the time actually missed by the employee. A deduction from pay as a penalty for violations of major safety rules under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be made in any amount. 541.603Effect of improper deductions from salary (a)An employer who makes improper deductions from salary shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis. An actual practice of making improper deductions demonstrates that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis. The factors to consider when determining whether an employer has an actual practice of making improper deductions include, but are not limited to: the number of improper deductions, particularly as compared to the number of employee infractions warranting discipline', ' the time period during which the employer made improper deductions', ' the number and geographic location of employees whose salary was improperly reduced', ' the number and geographic location of managers responsible for taking the improper deductions', ' and whether the employer has a clearly communicated policy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions.\n(b)If the facts demonstrate that the employer has an actual practice of making improper deductions, the exemption is lost during the time period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual improper deductions. Employees in different job classifications or who work for different managers do not lose their status as exempt employees. Thus, for example, if a manager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of engineers at that facility for partial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facility whose pay could have been improperly docked by the manager would lose the exemption', ' engineers at other facilities or working for other managers, however, would remain exempt. (c)Improper deductions that are either isolated or inadvertent will not result in loss of the exemption for any employees subject to such improper deductions, if the employer reimburses the employees for such improper deductions.\n(d)If an employer has a clearly communicated policy that prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in §541.602(a) and includes a complaint mechanism, reimburses employees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith commitment to comply in the future, such employer will not lose the exemption for any employees unless the employer willfully violates the policy by continuing to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints. If an employer fails to reimburse employees for any improper deductions or continues to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints, the exemption is lost during the time period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual improper deductions. The best evidence of a clearly communicated policy is a written policy that was distributed to employees prior to the improper pay deductions by, for example, providing a copy of the policy to employees at the time of hire, publishing the policy in an employee handbook or publishing the policy on the employer’s Intranet. (e)This section shall not be construed in an unduly technical manner so as to defeat the exemption.\n541.604Minimum guarantee plus extras\n(a)An employer may provide an exempt employee with additional compensation without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly-required amount paid on a salary basis. Thus, for example, an exempt employee guaranteed at least $684 each week paid on a salary basis may also receive additional compensation of a one percent commission on sales. An exempt employee also may receive a percentage of the sales or profits of the employer if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least $684 each week paid on a salary basis. Similarly, the exemption is not lost if an exempt employee who is guaranteed at least $684 each week paid on a salary basis also receives additional compensation based on hours worked for work beyond the normal workweek. Such additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., flat sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly amount, time and one-half or any other basis), and may include paid time off. (b)An exempt employee’s earnings may be computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis, without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly required amount paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days or shifts worked, and a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed amount and the amount actually earned. The reasonable relationship test will be met if the weekly guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee’s usual earnings at the assigned hourly, daily or shift rate for the employee’s normal scheduled workweek. Thus, for example, an exempt employee guaranteed compensation of at least $725 for any week in which the employee performs any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each week, may be paid $210 per shift without violating the $684-per-week salary basis requirement. The reasonable relationship requirement applies only if the employee’s pay is computed on an hourly, daily or shift basis. It does not apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a guaranteed salary per week that exceeds the current salary level who also receives a commission of one-half percent of all sales in the store or five percent of the store’s profits, which in some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the guaranteed salary.\n541.605Fee basis\n(a)Administrative and professional employees may be paid on a fee basis, rather than on a salary basis. An employee will be considered to be paid on a fee basis within the meaning of these regulations if the employee is paid an agreed sum for a single job regardless of the time required for its completion. These payments resemble piecework payments with the important distinction that generally a fee is paid for the kind of job that is unique rather than for a series of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times and for which payment on an identical basis is made over and over again. Payments based on the number of hours or days worked and not on the accomplishment of a given single task are not considered payments on a fee basis. (b)To determine whether the fee payment meets the minimum amount of salary required for exemption under these regulations, the amount paid to the employee will be tested by determining the time worked on the job and whether the fee payment is at a rate that would amount to at least the minimum salary per week, as required by §541.600(a) and 541.602(a), if the employee worked 40 hours. Thus, an artist paid $350 for a picture that took 20 hours to complete meets the $684 minimum salary requirement for exemption since earnings at this rate would yield the artist $700 if 40 hours were worked.\n541.606Board, lodging or other facilities\n(a)To qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must earn the minimum salary amount set forth in §541.600, exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities. The phrase exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities means free and clear or independent of any claimed credit for non-cash items of value that an employer may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs incurred by an employer to provide an employee with board, lodging or other facilities may not count towards the minimum salary amount required for exemption under this part 541. Such separate transactions are not prohibited between employers and their exempt employees, but the costs to employers associated with such transactions may not be considered when determining if an employee has received the full required minimum salary payment. (b)Regulations defining what constitutes board, lodging, or other facilities are contained in 29 CFR part 531. As described in 29 CFR 531.32, the term other facilities refers to items similar to board and lodging, such as meals furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or restaurants to their employees', ' meals, dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a college to its student employees', ' merchandise furnished at company stores or commissaries, including articles of food, clothing, and household effects', ' housing furnished for dwelling purposes', ' and transportation furnished to employees for ordinary commuting between their homes and work.\n541.607Reserved by 85 FR 34970 Effective: June 8, 2020 <<541.607 - Reserved.>>\nHDefinitions and Miscellaneous Provisions (§§541.700-541.710)\n541.700Primary duty\n(a)To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee’s primary duty must be the performance of exempt work. The term primary duty means the principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs. Determination of an employee’s primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a whole. Factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an employee include, but are not limited to, the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties', ' the amount of time spent performing exempt work', ' the employee’s relative freedom from direct supervision', ' and the relationship between the employee’s salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee. (b)The amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary duty of an employee. Thus, employees who spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary duty requirement. Time alone, however, is not the sole test, and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work. Employees who do not spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.\n(c)Thus, for example, assistant managers in a retail establishment who perform exempt executive work such as supervising and directing the work of other employees, ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if the assistant managers spend more than 50 percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the cash register. However, if such assistant managers are closely supervised and earn little more than the nonexempt employees, the assistant managers generally would not satisfy the primary duty requirement. 541.701Customarily and regularlyThe phrase customarily and regularly means a frequency that must be greater than occasional but which, of course, may be less than constant. Tasks or work performed customarily and regularly includes work normally and recurrently performed every workweek', ' it does not include isolated or one-time tasks.\n541.702Exempt and nonexempt workThe term exempt work means all work described in §541.100, 541.101, 541.200, 541.300, 541.301, 541.302, 541.303, 541.304, <<and>> 541.400 and 541.500, and the activities directly and closely related to such work. All other work is considered nonexempt. 541.703Directly and closely related (a)Work that is directly and closely related to the performance of exempt work is also considered exempt work. The phrase directly and closely related means tasks that are related to exempt duties and that contribute to or facilitate performance of exempt work. Thus, directly and closely related work may include physical tasks and menial tasks that arise out of exempt duties, and the routine work without which the exempt employee’s exempt work cannot be performed properly. Work directly and closely related to the performance of exempt duties may also include recordkeeping', ' monitoring and adjusting machinery', ' taking notes', ' using the computer to create documents or presentations', ' opening the mail for the purpose of reading it and making decisions', ' and using a photocopier or fax machine. Work is not directly and closely related if the work is remotely related or completely unrelated to exempt duties.\n(b)The following examples further illustrate the type of work that is and is not normally considered as directly and closely related to exempt work: (1)Keeping time, production or sales records for subordinates is work directly and closely related to an exempt executive’s function of managing a department and supervising employees.\n(2)The distribution of materials, merchandise or supplies to maintain control of the flow of and expenditures for such items is directly and closely related to the performance of exempt duties. (3)A supervisor who spot checks and examines the work of subordinates to determine whether they are performing their duties properly, and whether the product is satisfactory, is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions, so long as the checking is distinguishable from the work ordinarily performed by a nonexempt inspector.\n(4)A supervisor who sets up a machine may be engaged in exempt work, depending upon the nature of the industry and the operation. In some cases the setup work, or adjustment of the machine for a particular job, is typically performed by the same employees who operate the machine. Such setup work is part of the production operation and is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up of the work is a highly skilled operation which the ordinary production worker or machine tender typically does not perform. In large plants, non-supervisors may perform such work. However, particularly in small plants, such work may be a regular duty of the executive and is directly and closely related to the executive’s responsibility for the work performance of subordinates and for the adequacy of the final product. Under such circumstances, it is exempt work. (5)A department manager in a retail or service establishment who walks about the sales floor observing the work of sales personnel under the employee’s supervision to determine the effectiveness of their sales techniques, checks on the quality of customer service being given, or observes customer preferences is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions.\n(6)A business consultant may take extensive notes recording the flow of work and materials through the office or plant of the client', ' after returning to the office of the employer, the consultant may personally use the computer to type a report and create a proposed table of organization. Standing alone, or separated from the primary duty, such note-taking and typing would be routine in nature. However, because this work is necessary for analyzing the data and making recommendations, the work is directly and closely related to exempt work. While it is possible to assign note-taking and typing to nonexempt employees, and in fact it is frequently the practice to do so, delegating such routine tasks is not required as a condition of exemption. (7)A credit manager who makes and administers the credit<<budget>> policy of the employer<<employing office>>, establishes credit<<spending>> limits for customers<<the employing office>>, <<and>> authorizes the shipment of orders on credit, and makes decisions on whether to exceed credit limits<<expenditures>> would be performing work exempt under §541.200. Work that is directly and closely related to these exempt duties may include checking the status of accounts to determine whether the credit limit would be exceeded by the shipment of a new order, removing credit reports from the files for analysis, and writing letters giving credit data and experience to other employers or credit agencies.\n(8)A traffic manager in charge of planning a company’s transportation, including the most economical and quickest routes for shipping merchandise to and from the plant, contracting for common-carrier and other transportation facilities, negotiating with carriers for adjustments for damages to merchandise, and making the necessary rearrangements resulting from delays, damages or irregularities in transit, is performing exempt work. If the employee also spends part of the day taking telephone orders for local deliveries, such order-taking is a routine function and is not directly and closely related to the exempt work. (9)An example of work directly and closely related to exempt professional duties is a chemist performing menial tasks such as cleaning a test tube in the middle of an original experiment, even though such menial tasks can be assigned to laboratory assistants.\n(10)A teacher performs work directly and closely related to exempt duties when, while taking students on a field trip, the teacher drives a school van or monitors the students’ behavior in a restaurant. 541.704Use of manualsThe use of manuals, guidelines or other established procedures containing or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the Act or the regulations in this part. Such manuals and procedures provide guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such reference material would not affect an employee’s exempt status. The section 13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, however, for employees who simply apply well-established techniques or procedures described in manuals or other sources within closely prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances.\n541.705TraineesThe executive, administrative, professional, outside sales and computer employee exemptions do not apply to employees training for employment in an executive, administrative, professional, outside sales or computer employee capacity who are not actually performing the duties of an executive, administrative, professional, outside sales or computer employee.  541.706Emergencies (a)An exempt employee will not lose the exemption by performing work of a normally nonexempt nature because of the existence of an emergency. Thus, when emergencies arise that threaten the safety of employees, a cessation of operations or serious damage to the employer’s property, any work performed in an effort to prevent such results is considered exempt work.\n(b)An emergency does not include occurrences that are not beyond control or for which the employer can reasonably provide in the normal course of business. Emergencies generally occur only rarely, and are events that the employer cannot reasonably anticipate. (c)The following examples illustrate the distinction between emergency work considered exempt work and routine work that is not exempt work:\n(1)A mine superintendent who pitches in after an explosion and digs out workers who are trapped in the mine is still a bona fide executive.<<Reserved.>> (2)Assisting nonexempt employees with their work during periods of heavy workload or to handle rush orders is not exempt work.\n(3)Replacing a nonexempt employee during the first day or partial day of an illness may be considered exempt emergency work depending on factors such as the size of the establishment<<location>> and of the executive’s department, the nature of the industry<<work performed by the employing office>>, the consequences that would flow from the failure to replace the ailing employee immediately, and the feasibility of filling the employee’s place promptly. (4)Regular repair and cleaning of equipment is not emergency work, even when necessary to prevent fire or explosion', ' however, repairing equipment may be emergency work if the breakdown of or damage to the equipment was caused by accident or carelessness that the employer could not reasonably anticipate.\n541.707Occasional tasksOccasional, infrequently recurring tasks that cannot practicably be performed by nonexempt employees, but are the means for an exempt employee to properly carry out exempt functions and responsibilities, are considered exempt work. The following factors should be considered in determining whether such work is exempt work: Whether the same work is performed by any of the exempt employee’s subordinates', ' practicability of delegating the work to a nonexempt employee', ' whether the exempt employee performs the task frequently or occasionally', ' and existence of an industry practice for the exempt employee to perform the task.  541.708Combination exemptionsEmployees who perform a combination of exempt duties as set forth in the regulations in this part for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales and computer employees may qualify for exemption. Thus, for example, an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt administrative and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption. In other words, work that is exempt under one section of this part will not defeat the exemption under any other section.\n541.709Motion picture producing industry\nThe requirement that the employee be paid on a salary basis does not apply to an employee in the motion picture producing industry who is compensated at a base rate of at least $1,043 per week (exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities). Thus, an employee in this industry who is otherwise exempt under subparts B, C, or D of this part, and who is employed at a base rate of at least the applicable current minimum amount a week is exempt if paid a proportionate amount (based on a week of not more than 6 days) for any week in which the employee does not work a full workweek for any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt employee in this industry qualifies for exemption if the employee is employed at a daily rate under the following circumstances: (a)The employee is in a job category for which a weekly base rate is not provided and the daily base rate would yield at least the minimum weekly amount if 6 days were worked', ' or\n(b)The employee is in a job category having the minimum weekly base rate and the daily base rate is at least one-sixth of such weekly base rate. 541.709<<Reserved.>> 541.710Employees of public agencies<<Effect of certain deductions on exempt employee pay>> (a)An employee of a public agency who otherwise meets the salary basis requirements of §541.602 shall not be disqualified from exemption under §541.100, 541.200, 541.300 or 541.400 on the basis that such employee is paid according to a pay system established by statute, ordinance or regulation, or by a policy or practice established pursuant to principles of public accountability, under which the employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which requires the public agency employee’s pay to be reduced or such employee to be placed on leave without pay for absences for personal reasons or because of illness or injury of less than one work-day when accrued leave is not used by an employee because:\n(1)Permission for its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied', ' (2)Accrued leave has been exhausted', ' or\n(3)The employee chooses to use leave without pay. (b)Deductions from the pay of an employee of a public agency for absences due to a budget-required furlough shall not disqualify the employee from being paid on a salary basis except in the workweek in which the furlough occurs and for which the employee’s pay is accordingly reduced..\n\nCheryl L.

and trafficking of gold and other valuable minerals', 'Whereas illicit gold mining is a significant challenge across Latin America, specifically in the Andean and Amazonian regions, where, according

in that country being mined illicitly', '(2)Colombia and Ecuador closely follow with approximately 80 percent of the gold extracted in those countries being mined illicitly', ' and(3)nearly 30 percent

in illicit profits to bolster their strength and long-term viability', ' Whereas the profits derived from illicit gold mining have become a leading source of the illicit financial activities in the region, surpassing the profits generated by coca and cocaine production in recent years', ' Whereas transnational criminal organizations use illicit gold trafficking as a mechanism to launder profits from other illicit activities, which frequently threatens the national security of the United States and undermines legal international trade by compromising the lawful gold supply chain and

profoundly threatens the safety, security, and cultural integrity of indigenous communities across Latin America', 'Whereas illicit gold mining often devastates the environment and is destructive to rural and indigenous communities since it violates legal standards and safety requirements and often involves the illegal use of mercury, a potent toxin that, when used improperly, contaminates water supplies in the areas surrounding illicit mining sites, and can result in acute and long-term poisoning in people', 'Whereas the recent activities associated with illicit gold mining include cutting down rainforests and creating pools of stagnant water, which contribute to the spread of mosquitoes and insect-borne disease, inciting an epidemic of malaria in Venezuela at levels not seen in the past 75 years', 'Whereas in May 2016, former President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, declared a 60-day emergency in the Madre de Dios region near Peru’s southeastern border with Brazil in an attempt to

the unique ecosystems of the Amazon, including World Heritage Site Canaima National Park, which is the ancestral land of the Pemón indigenous people and where at least 59 mining sites have been detected', ' Whereas corruption and the weak rule of law in Venezuela has allowed transnational criminal organizations, drug trafficking organizations, insurgent groups, and other armed groups to control and financially benefit from illicit mining operations, many of which have exerted control over different parts of the Orinoco Mining Arc region and beyond, such as Yapacana National Park and the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, home to indigenous communities of 17 ethnic groups, including the Yanomami and Ye’kuana tribes', ' Whereas, according to the Center for Strategic and

Article I: Abuse of PowerThe Constitution provides that the House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment and that the President shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.In his conduct as the former Vice President and current President of the United States, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the offices of the Vice Presidency and President of the United States, and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, defend, the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—Joseph Robinette Biden abused the power of the Office of the Vice President, enabling bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors, by allowing his son to influence the domestic policy of a foreign nation and accept various benefits—including financial compensation—from foreign nationals in exchange for certain favors.As Vice President, Joseph Biden was the senior Obama Administration official overseeing anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Hence, any illegal activity involving corruption conducted by Hunter Biden within or in relation to Ukraine would fall under the purview of the Office of Vice President Biden and the Obama State Department’s anti-corruption efforts. In fact, many State Department officials within the Obama Administration repeatedly registered reservations about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a corrupt company. Thus, any instances of corruption on behalf of Hunter Biden via his role as a board member of the Ukrainian-operated Burisma energy firm were either not investigated or covered up. The evidence of widespread knowledge, corruption, and collusion on behalf of the Biden family with foreign nationals is clear and compelling. Among other examples, it has been materially demonstrated that: (1)According to the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, the Vice President’s office and State Department officials were aware but ignored concerns relating to Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian-based natural gas company (hereafter, Burisma).(2)According to the same sources, Hunter Biden’s and his family’s financial transactions with Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh, and Chinese nationals raise criminal concerns and extortion threats.(3)In early 2015 the former Acting Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, George Kent, raised concerns to officials in Vice President Joe Biden’s office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden’s role on Burisma’s board. Kent’s concerns went unaddressed, and in September 2016, he emphasized in an email to his colleagues, Furthermore, the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine..(4)In October 2015, senior State Department official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, that Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine. Vice President Biden did not resolve this conflict of interest. Instead, he enabled it. (5)In addition to the over $4 million paid by Burisma for Hunter Biden’s board membership, Hunter Biden, and his family received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with questionable backgrounds. Specifically, the ongoing FBI investigation into Hunter Biden’s laptop revealed that Hunter received a 2.8 carat diamond gift from a high-ranking Chinese official in 2017. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker Magazine that he felt uncomfortable receiving the diamond and gave it to other associates. (6)Hunter Biden had business associations with Ye Jianming, founder of the CEFC China Energy Company, Ltd., Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People’s Liberation Army. Those associations resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow. There exists a vast web of corporate connections and financial transactions between and among the Biden family and Chinese nationals.(7)Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.(8)In 2016, Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had an active and ongoing investigation into Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter Biden continued to serve on Burisma’s board of directors. According to news reports, then Vice-President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss [Shokin]. After that, Ukraine’s Parliament fired Shokin.(9)Hunter Biden received millions of dollars from foreign sources as a result of business relationships that he built during the period when his father was Vice President of the United States and after. The financial transactions which Hunter engaged in illustrate serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.(10)Hunter Biden’s work with Chinese nationals connected to the Communist regime illustrate the deep financial connections that accelerated while his father was Vice President and continued after he left office.(11)On June 23, 2011, Sean Conlon, a business associate of Hunter Biden, suggested that a $10 billion deal could be struck in exchange for certain persons meeting Vice President Biden. This shows deliberate pay-for-play and quid-pro-quo. The email, in full, to Robert Biden, from Sean Conlon, is as follows:(A)So we have engagement letter if they get other 10 bonds they have a face value of 10b. While it is far fetched Devon [Archer] said he talked to his professor and these get traded. We get 10% in fees. We need to get these guys to an event or something where they get to just formally meet your Dad. For follow on they can talk to Chief of Staff. Let me know how soon we can do that. V brief. If Nagi get that done we get more bonds to move. Regards your hard working partner in Positano! Sean (emphasis added).(12)Emails between Hunter Biden and his cousin reveal that the President of Hunter’s Chinese Communist Party-linked firm, Eric Schwerin, repeatedly asked Hunter for an appointment to the Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad—a position he ultimately received. The email from Hunter to his cousin, Missy, regarding the request for the appointment to the Commission is as follows:(A)Eric asked for one of these [an appointment] the day after the election in 2008. You know better than me what are real and interesting appointments. Let’s go through the list with Steve and see what makes sense. I don’t know how much 2016 and nepotism plays into it..In all of this, President Biden gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. Through blatant nepotism, he enabled his son to influence foreign policy and financially benefit as a result of his role as Vice President. He supported his son engaging in collusion with Chinese Communist Party-linked officials. He allowed his son to trade appointments with his father and other high-ranking administration officials in exchange for financial compensation. He permitted his son to take money from Russian oligarchs, including Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.In so doing, Joseph R. Biden threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He thereby betrayed his trust as former Vice President and current President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. President Biden thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. ']",0.5391720242172591

dating violence includes 4 types of behavior: (1) physical violence, (2) sexual violence, (3) psychological aggression, and (4) stalking', 'Whereas according to the National Institute of Justice and Statistics, technology-facilitated abuse is a growing social malady contributing to increased psychological aggression among teens', ' Whereas technology-facilitated abuse includes, but is not limited

in the previous year said they had been the victim of at least one form of digital dating abuse', ' Whereas while dating violence, domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking affect individuals regardless of age, teens are especially vulnerable', 'Whereas according to the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, almost half (44.3 percent) of teens experienced at least one type of violence and 1 in 7

poverty, low capital, such as lack of institutions, relationships, and norms that shape a community’s social interactions, poor neighborhood support and cohesion, weak community sanctions against intimate partner violence, and high alcohol outlet density, that place individuals at greater risk for perpetrating intimate partner violence', 'Whereas the CDC also indicates that community factors, such as neighborhood collective efficacy, and coordination of resources and services among community agencies, may reduce an individual’s risk of perpetrating intimate partner violence', 'Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of addressing teen dating violence, and many successful examples of such programs include education, community outreach, and social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate', 'Whereas evidence-based programs such as the Coaching Boys Into Men program have demonstrated that teaching adolescent men how to have healthy and nonviolent relationships

Trump has abused the powers of the Presidency in an attempt to circumvent and subvert the rule of law by inciting an insurrection against the Government of the United States of America, in that:  In a pattern of conduct attempting to create an insurrection against the Government of the United States, Donald J. Trump spread disinformation and allegations unsupported by any evidence regarding voter fraud in the 2020 United States Presidential election and the results of the 2020 United States Presidential election, and explicitly encouraged his supporters to descend on Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, while Congress engaged in its constitutionally mandated legislative business of certifying the electoral college results of the 2020 United States Presidential election.\nPrior to January 6, 2021, Donald J. Trump told white supremacists to stand back and stand by, an appeal to white supremacy consistent with his prior remarks and conduct, including an August 31, 2020, statement in defense of an extremist charged with murdering peaceful protestors and an August 15, 2017, statement defending white supremacists who had committed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, as very fine people. On December 20, 2020, Donald J. Trump stated that the January 6, 2021, show of force he purposefully incited would be wild. On January 6, 2021, Donald J. Trump explicitly told his supporters to fight like hell, and you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength.. Shortly thereafter, those same supporters engaged in mass riots and insurrection on the grounds of the United States Capitol, leading to the breach and destruction of the Capitol building while Congress was in session conducting legislative business, as well as the death of at least five individuals, including a Capitol Police officer. The siege of the United States Capitol at the hands of Donald J. Trump created widespread terror, threatened the lives of members of the United States Congress, completely disrupted legislative business, threatened the continuity of government, and exposed the United States to grave national security risks. \nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has betrayed his trust as President, has acted in a manner which threatens the integrity and security of the United States Government and its people, has subverted the Constitution of the United States, the democratic process, and the rule of law and justice, has conspired to commit sedition and incited an insurrection against the United States Government, and has behaved in a manner grossly incompatible with the office of the President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.  Wherefore, Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\nArticle II\nIn his conduct of the office of President of the United States—in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—Donald J. Trump has abused the powers of the Presidency in an attempt to circumvent and subvert the rule of law by corrupting the electoral process, in that: In a pattern of conduct dedicated to corrupting the electoral process, Donald J. Trump solicited a foreign government, Ukraine, to intervene in the 2020 United States Presidential election by requesting that the Government of Ukraine publicly announce baseless investigations into his political rival to the benefit of his potential reelection. Donald J. Trump sought to ensure such investigations by conditioning United States Government support and acts of value on the acquiescence of the Government of Ukraine to Donald J. Trump’s demands. In so doing, Donald J. Trump abused the power of the Presidency by subverting the rule of law in a manner that undermined national security and violated his duties to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. \nFollowing the results of the 2020 United States Presidential election, in a January 2, 2021, discussion between Donald J. Trump and Georgia State officials, Donald J. Trump solicited the assistance of the Georgia Secretary of State in overturning the free and fair election results in the State of Georgia, stating that I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. When the Georgia Secretary of State did not agree to his demands, Donald J. Trump threatened the Georgia officials with criminal prosecution if they didn’t comply, stating that leaving the vote counts intact would be a big risk.  Further, during the 2016 United States Presidential election, Donald J. Trump approved and directed a surreptitious and unlawful payment of substantial sums of money to obtain the silence of persons with unfavorable information about him in order to influence the 2016 United States Presidential election. \nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has betrayed his trust as President, has acted in a manner which threatens the integrity and security of the United States Government and its people, has subverted the Constitution of the United States, the democratic process, and the rule of law and justice, has purposefully and maliciously corrupted public faith and trust in the electoral process, and has behaved in a manner grossly incompatible with the office of the President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.  Wherefore, Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of article I, section 9, clause 8 and article II, section 1, clause 7 of the Constitution, has accepted emoluments from foreign states without the consent of Congress and has received and accepted emoluments from the United States and from individual States, and in doing so, Donald J. Trump has run afoul of anticorruption provisions of the United States Constitution, in that: In attempts to leverage the office of the President of the United States for personal profit, Donald J. Trump solicited and received from foreign governments presents and emoluments, designed to curry favor and to influence him. To facilitate his receipt of emoluments from foreign states, Donald J. Trump has failed to divest his ownership stakes in, or meaningfully separate himself from, the Trump Organization’s vast network of business holdings, which engage with foreign governments. Through those business holdings, Donald J. Trump has received, and continues to receive, presents and emoluments, either directly or indirectly, from foreign governments. His receipt of presents and emoluments from foreign states creates both a conflict of interest between his personal business interests and his responsibilities as President of the United States, and an appearance that he is beholden to the foreign states from which he received the emoluments. \nDonald J. Trump has failed to disclose to Congress, or the public, the full extent of the presents or emoluments he has received from foreign states through his business interests, thereby violating his constitutional responsibility to obtain congressional consent to obtain such emoluments as required by article I, section 9, clause 8. Further, Donald J. Trump’s receipt of emoluments and additional payments—including from lease agreements, other rental property agreements such as that with the General Services Administration for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, and payments from Federal agencies such as the United States Secret Service—from the United States and from individual States beyond his salary directly violates article II, section 1, clause 7 of the United States Constitution, which prohibits the President from receiving benefits, monetary or otherwise, from the Federal Government, State governments, local governments, or their instrumentalities beyond the fixed Presidential compensation. \nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has used the power of his office for improper personal gain, has abused and exceeded the lawful powers of his office, has undermined the integrity of his office, has betrayed his trust as President, and has behaved in a manner grossly incompatible with the office of the President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore, Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\nArticle IV\nIn his conduct of the office of President of the United States—in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—Donald J. Trump has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: In a pattern of conduct solely dedicated to the obstruction of the administration of justice, on June 17, 2017, Donald J. Trump directed the firing of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III, who was investigating coordination between the 2016 Donald J. Trump United States Presidential campaign and the Russian Government, and in early 2018, Donald J. Trump ordered Federal officials to lie about this June 17, 2017, directive. Donald J. Trump further directed or compelled agencies, personnel, and former personnel of the executive branch to refuse to comply with lawful congressional requests for information and testimony, and otherwise suppressed cooperation with congressional inquiries. \nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has betrayed his trust as President, has acted in a manner which threatens the integrity and security of the United States Government and its people, has subverted the Constitution of the United States, the democratic process, and the rule of law and justice, and has behaved in a manner grossly incompatible with the office of the President of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

In her conduct of the office of Vice President of the United States—and in violation of her constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of Vice President of the United States and, to the best of her ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of her constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—Kamala Devi Harris has betrayed the public trust as Vice President of the United States, in that: Vice President Harris has violated her oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic by supporting President Biden’s abysmal oversight of the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan.On April 25, 2021, Vice President Harris confirmed she was the last person in the room when President Biden made the decision to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan and stated, I have seen him over and over again make decisions based exactly on what he believes is right.Vice President Harris neglected her duties as Vice President by failing to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Biden from office due to his clear inability to effectively and competently handle his duties as Commander in Chief. President Biden has demonstrated repeated memory issues that range from forgetting the name of the Pentagon, Department of Defense, and Secretary of Defense, to forgetting the purpose of his visit to survey winter storm damage in Texas. He has also refused multiple times to take a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), like his predecessor, at the request of Members of Congress. Furthermore, the American people have lost trust in President Biden’s ability to lead. As of August 22, 2021, 51 percent of Americans do not feel that President Biden has acted competently as President of the United States, 74 percent of Americans believe the removal of American troops from Afghanistan has gone badly, and 50 percent of Americans disapprove of the way President Biden is handling his job as Commander in Chief. By neglecting to invoke the 25th Amendment, Vice President Kamala Harris has betrayed the public trust. On August 23, 2021, Vice President Harris called President Biden’s plan to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan courageous and fair. This decision has resulted in the Taliban gaining full control of Afghanistan and jeopardized the safety of, and in some cases directly resulted in the death of, United States citizens, United States Armed Forces members, and Afghan civilians. The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized as courageous and fair has resulted in the rapid takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban and has compromised the physical security of tens of thousands of United States military personnel, United States Government operatives, United States civilians, Afghan allies, other international allies, and tens of billions of dollars of advanced United States military equipment.The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized as courageous and fair has led to international condemnation of the United States, including from our allies.The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized as courageous and fair has diminished the United States standing on the international stage, allowing adversaries such as Russia and China to call into question the ability of the United States to fulfill its military and defense commitments. On August 22, 2021, Vice President Harris neglected her duties as Vice President and ignored the crisis in Afghanistan by taking a week-long regional tour of Southeast Asia amidst the fall of Kabul and a suicide bomb explosion executed by terrorist group ISIS–K that occurred at Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing 11 Marines, 1 Navy Medic, and 1 Army soldier, and injuring over 20 Americans.In doing this, Vice President Kamala Devi Harris has directly betrayed the public trust of the United States, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.Vice President Harris by such conduct, has demonstrated that she will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law. Vice President Harris thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.']",0.7533667495394413
